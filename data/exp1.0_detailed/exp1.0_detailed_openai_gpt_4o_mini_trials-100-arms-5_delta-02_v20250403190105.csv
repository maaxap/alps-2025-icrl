From this summary, we can see that the yellow and purple buttons have the highest success rates (100%). However, the yellow button has been pressed more times (2) compared to the purple button (1), which gives us more confidence in its performance.

Given that the yellow button has shown consistent good outcomes and has been tested more than the purple button, it would be a safer choice to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button next.

The purple button has the highest success rate, but it has only been pressed once. The yellow button has a good success rate with more trials (3), and it has shown a good outcome in 2 out of 3 attempts.

Given that we want to maximize our total reward and considering both the success rates and the number of trials, I will choose the yellow button next, as it has a solid success rate and has been tested enough to give us a reliable estimate of its performance.

The purple button has the highest success rate (100%) but has only been pressed once. The red button has the lowest success rate (0%) and has not yielded any good outcomes. 

Given that the purple button has shown a good outcome in its only trial, it might be a good candidate to press again. However, since it has only been tested once, we should also consider the other buttons that have been tested more frequently.

The blue, green, and yellow buttons all have a 50% success rate, but they have also shown variability in their outcomes. 

Considering the balance between exploration (trying new options) and exploitation (choosing the best-known option), I will choose to press the purple button again, as it has shown a perfect outcome so far.

From the analysis, we see that the blue, green, yellow, and purple buttons all have a success rate of 50%, while the red button has a success rate of 0%. Since the red button has not yielded any good outcomes, it is not a good choice.

Given that the other buttons have the same success rate, we can consider pressing one of the buttons that we have pressed more frequently, as we have more data on their performance. The blue and yellow buttons have been pressed the most (4 times each), and both have shown a 50% success rate.

   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 2
   - Success rate: 1/3 ≈ 0.3333

Now, let's summarize the success rates:
- Blue: 0.4
- Green: 0.3913
- Red: 0
- Yellow: 0.4
- Purple: 0.3333

The blue and yellow buttons have the highest success rates (0.4). Since both have the same success rate, we can consider the number of times they have been pressed. The blue button has been pressed 5 times, while the yellow button has also been pressed 5 times. 

Given that the blue button has a slightly better success rate than the green button, and both blue and yellow have the same success rate, I will choose the blue button for the next press.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed: 13 times
   - Good outcomes: 5
   - Bad outcomes: 8
   - Success rate: 5/13 ≈ 0.385

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed: 24 times
   - Good outcomes: 9
   - Bad outcomes: 15
   - Success rate: 9/24 ≈ 0.375

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed: 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0/1 = 0.0 (not enough data)

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed: 14 times
   - Good outcomes: 10
   - Bad outcomes: 4
   - Success rate: 10/14 ≈ 0.714

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed: 3 times
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 2
   - Success rate: 1/3 ≈ 0.333

From the analysis, the yellow button has the highest success rate (≈ 0.714), followed by blue (≈ 0.385) and green (≈ 0.375). The red button has insufficient data, and the purple button has the lowest success rate (≈ 0.333).

Given that the yellow button has performed the best so far, I will choose to press the yellow button next.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 13 times

   - Success rate = 1 / 3 ≈ 0.333

Now, comparing the success rates:
- Blue: 0.385
- Green: 0.375
- Red: 0.0
- Yellow: 0.733 (highest)
- Purple: 0.333

The yellow button has the highest success rate at approximately 0.733, indicating it has provided the best outcomes relative to the number of times it has been pressed.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To decide which button to press next, we need to analyze the performance of each button based on the rewards received so far. 

Here's a summary of the performance for each button:

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed: 13 times
   - Good outcomes: 5
   - Bad outcomes: 8
   - Success rate: 5/13 ≈ 0.385

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed: 24 times
   - Good outcomes: 9
   - Bad outcomes: 15
   - Success rate: 9/24 ≈ 0.375

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed: 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0/1 = 0.0 (not a good choice due to insufficient data)

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed: 23 times
   - Good outcomes: 16
   - Bad outcomes: 7
   - Success rate: 16/23 ≈ 0.696

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed: 3 times
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 2
   - Success rate: 1/3 ≈ 0.333

From the analysis, the yellow button has the highest success rate (≈ 0.696), followed by the blue button (≈ 0.385) and the green button (≈ 0.375). The red and purple buttons have low success rates and insufficient data to make them viable options.

Given that the yellow button has performed the best so far, it is the most promising choice for maximizing the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button next.

   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0/1 = 0.0 (not a good choice due to insufficient data)

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed: 49 times

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed: 3 times
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 2
   - Success rate: 1/3 ≈ 0.333

From the analysis, the yellow button has the highest success rate (approximately 0.694), followed by the blue button (approximately 0.385) and the green button (approximately 0.375). The red and purple buttons have low success rates and insufficient data.

Given that the yellow button has performed the best in terms of success rate, it is the most promising choice for maximizing the total reward.

   - Success rate = 5 / 13 ≈ 0.385

2. **Green Button**:

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To decide which button to press next, let's analyze the data provided for each button:

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 13 times
   - Good outcomes: 5
   - Bad outcomes: 8
   - Success rate: 5/13 ≈ 0.385

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 24 times
   - Good outcomes: 9
   - Bad outcomes: 15
   - Success rate: 9/24 ≈ 0.375

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0/1 = 0.0 (not enough data)

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 58 times
   - Good outcomes: 40
   - Bad outcomes: 18
   - Success rate: 40/58 ≈ 0.690

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 3 times
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 2
   - Success rate: 1/3 ≈ 0.333

From the analysis, the yellow button has the highest success rate (≈ 0.690), followed by the blue button (≈ 0.385) and the green button (≈ 0.375). The red and purple buttons have either insufficient data or lower success rates.

Given that we want to maximize the total reward and the yellow button has shown the best performance so far, it would be the most logical choice to press next.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button.
