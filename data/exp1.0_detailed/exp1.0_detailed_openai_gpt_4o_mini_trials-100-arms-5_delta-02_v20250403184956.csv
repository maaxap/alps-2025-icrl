1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 8 times
   - 8 good outcomes, 0 bad outcomes
   - This button has shown a perfect success rate so far.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - 1 good outcome, 0 bad outcomes
   - This button has also shown a perfect success rate, but only pressed once.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - 1 good outcome, 0 bad outcomes
   - Similar to the green button, it has a perfect success rate but limited data.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - 1 good outcome, 0 bad outcomes
   - Again, perfect success rate but limited data.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome
   - This button has not performed well at all.

Given that the blue button has the most data and a perfect success rate, it is the most reliable choice. The other buttons (green, red, yellow) have only been pressed once, and while they have also shown good outcomes, they lack the data to confidently suggest they are better than the blue button.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the blue button.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 18 times
   - Good outcomes: 16
   - Bad outcomes: 2
   - Success rate: 16/18 = 0.89 (approximately)

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 0
   - Success rate: 1/1 = 1.00

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time

   - Success rate: 1/1 = 1.00

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 0
   - Success rate: 1/1 = 1.00

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0/1 = 0.00

From this analysis, the blue button has the highest success rate (0.89) based on a significant number of trials (18). The green, red, and yellow buttons have perfect success rates, but they have only been pressed once each, which makes their results less reliable due to the small sample size. The purple button has performed poorly and should be avoided.

Given that the blue button has a strong track record and has been tested extensively, it is the best choice for maximizing the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the blue button next.

   - Good outcomes: 24
   - Bad outcomes: 3
   - Success rate: 24/27 ≈ 0.89

2. **Green Button**:

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0/1 = 0.00

From this analysis, the blue button has the highest number of trials and a high success rate of approximately 0.89. The green, red, and yellow buttons have only been pressed once and have a perfect success rate, but we have very little data on them. The purple button has performed poorly and should be avoided.

Given that the blue button has a strong track record and has been tested extensively, it is the safest choice to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the blue button next.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 35 times
   - Good outcomes: 27
   - Bad outcomes: 8
   - Success rate: 27/35 ≈ 0.77

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 1/2 = 0.5

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 0
   - Success rate: 1/1 = 1.0

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 0
   - Success rate: 1/1 = 1.0

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0/1 = 0.0

From this analysis, the blue button has the highest success rate (approximately 0.77) and has been tested the most, providing a reliable estimate of its performance. The red and yellow buttons have perfect success rates, but they have only been pressed once each, making their estimates less reliable due to the small sample size. The green button has a success rate of 0.5, and the purple button has a success rate of 0.0, which makes them less favorable choices.

Given that the blue button has the highest success rate and a substantial number of trials, it is the best choice for maximizing the total reward.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0 / 1 = 0.00 (0%)

From this analysis, the blue button has the highest success rate (70%) based on the number of times it has been pressed. The red and yellow buttons have a perfect success rate, but they have only been pressed once each, which makes their results less reliable due to the small sample size.

   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0 / 1 = 0.0 (0%)

From this analysis, the blue button has the highest success rate (approximately 69.23%) and has been tested the most, providing a reliable estimate of its performance. The red and yellow buttons have a perfect success rate, but they have only been pressed once each, making their estimates less reliable due to the small sample size. The green button has a moderate success rate but has also been pressed very few times. The purple button has performed poorly.

Given that the blue button has the most data and the highest success rate, it is the best choice for maximizing the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the blue button next.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To decide which button to press next, let's analyze the data provided:

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 70 times
   - Good outcomes: 44
   - Bad outcomes: 26
   - Success rate: 44/70 = 0.6286 (approximately 62.86%)

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 1/2 = 0.5 (50%)

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 0
   - Success rate: 1/1 = 1.0 (100%)

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 0
   - Success rate: 1/1 = 1.0 (100%)

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0/1 = 0.0 (0%)

From this analysis, the blue button has the highest success rate (approximately 62.86%) based on a significant number of trials (70). The red and yellow buttons have a perfect success rate, but they have only been pressed once each, which makes their success rates less reliable due to the small sample size.

Given that the blue button has a solid track record and a substantial number of trials, it is the most reliable choice. 

Therefore, I will choose the blue button for the next press.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 79 times
   - Good outcomes: 47
   - Bad outcomes: 32
   - Success rate: 47 / 79 ≈ 0.596 (or 59.6%)

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 1 / 2 = 0.5 (or 50%)

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 0
   - Success rate: 1 / 1 = 1.0 (or 100%)

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 1
   - Bad outcomes: 0
   - Success rate: 1 / 1 = 1.0 (or 100%)

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0 / 1 = 0.0 (or 0%)

From this analysis, the blue button has the highest number of trials and a reasonable success rate of about 59.6%. The red and yellow buttons have a perfect success rate, but they have only been pressed once each, which makes their success rates less reliable due to the small sample size.

Given that the blue button has a significant amount of data backing its performance, it is a safer choice compared to the others, especially since it has been tested extensively.

Therefore, I will choose the blue button for the next press.

From this analysis, the yellow button has the highest success rate of 100%, but it has only been pressed 2 times. The blue button has a decent success rate of about 58.14% and has been pressed significantly more times, which gives us more confidence in its performance.

Given that we have only 7 time steps left, it would be wise to choose the button with the highest success rate that has also been tested enough to provide reliable data. The yellow button has the highest success rate, and since it has performed perfectly in its limited trials, it is a strong candidate.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button for the next press.
