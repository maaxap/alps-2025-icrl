1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Not a good choice since it has only produced bad outcomes.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to blue, it has only produced bad outcomes.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 16 times, 8 good outcomes, 8 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a 50% success rate. It has been tested the most, but the results are mixed.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like blue and green, it has only produced bad outcomes.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, 2 good outcomes, 0 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a 100% success rate so far, but it has been tested only twice.

Given this analysis, the purple button has shown the best performance with a 100% success rate, even though it has been pressed only twice. The red button has a decent success rate but has been pressed significantly more times, leading to a higher risk of bad outcomes.

Since we want to maximize our total reward and the purple button has shown the best results, I will choose to press the purple button next.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Not a good choice since it has not yielded any good outcomes.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to blue, it has not yielded any good outcomes.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 16 times, 8 good outcomes, 8 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a 50% success rate. It has been tested the most but has not shown a strong preference for good outcomes.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like blue and green, it has not yielded any good outcomes.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 12 times, 9 good outcomes, 3 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a success rate of 75%, which is significantly better than the others.

Given this analysis, the purple button has the highest success rate and has yielded the most good outcomes compared to the other buttons. Therefore, it is the best choice for maximizing the total reward.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Not a good choice since it has not yielded any positive rewards.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to blue, it has not yielded any positive rewards.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 16 times, 8 good outcomes, 8 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a 50% success rate. It has been tested more than the others and has shown some potential.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like blue and green, it has not yielded any positive rewards.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 22 times, 13 good outcomes, 9 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a success rate of approximately 59.1% (13 good out of 22 total). It has been the most successful option so far.

Given this analysis, the purple button has the highest success rate and has been pressed the most times, indicating it is likely to yield a good reward based on past performance.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the purple button.

   - Not a good choice since it has only produced bad outcomes.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to blue, it has only produced bad outcomes.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 16 times, 8 good outcomes, 8 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a 50% success rate. It has potential but is not the best performer.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like blue and green, it has only produced bad outcomes.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 32 times, 22 good outcomes, 10 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a success rate of approximately 68.75%, making it the best performer among all buttons.

Given that the purple button has the highest success rate and has been pressed the most times with a significant number of good outcomes, it is the best choice for maximizing the total reward.

   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like the blue and green buttons, it has only been pressed once and resulted in a bad outcome.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 61 times, 42 good outcomes, 19 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a success rate of approximately 68.85% (42 good outcomes out of 61 presses). This is the highest success rate among all the buttons.

Given that the purple button has the highest success rate and has been tested the most, it is the best choice for maximizing the total reward.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Not a good choice since it has only produced bad outcomes.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to blue, it has only produced bad outcomes.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 16 times, 8 good outcomes, 8 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a 50% success rate. It has potential but is not the best performer.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like blue and green, it has only produced bad outcomes.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 71 times, 49 good outcomes, 22 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a success rate of approximately 69%. It has been the most successful option so far.

Given that the purple button has the highest success rate and has been pressed the most times, it is the best choice for maximizing the total reward in the remaining time steps.

Therefore, I will choose the purple button next.
