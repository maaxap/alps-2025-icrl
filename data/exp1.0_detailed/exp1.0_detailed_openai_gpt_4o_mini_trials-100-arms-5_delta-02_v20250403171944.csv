4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome. Again, similar to blue and red, indicating a low mean reward.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. We have no data on this button, but it could potentially have a higher mean reward since it hasn't been tested yet.

Given that the purple button has not been pressed at all, it is a candidate for exploration. Since all other buttons have shown poor performance, pressing the purple button could provide new information and possibly a better reward.

Therefore, I will choose the purple button for the next press.

   - Not promising based on this single trial.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 17 times, 5 good outcomes, 12 bad outcomes.
   - This gives a success rate of approximately 29.4% (5/17). It has the most data but is not performing well.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to blue, not promising.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Also not promising.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Not promising as well.

Given that the green button has the most data, it might be the best option despite its low success rate. The other buttons have only been pressed once and have shown no good outcomes, which makes them less reliable.

Since the green button has the most experience and is the only button with a non-zero number of good outcomes, I will choose the green button for the next press.

You have 100 time steps and, on each time step, you can choose any button and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps.

At each time step, I will show you a summary of your past choices and rewards. Then you must make the next choice, which must be exactly one of blue, red, green, yellow, purple.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Not a good choice since it has not yielded any positive rewards.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 37 times, 16 good outcomes, 21 bad outcomes.
   - This button has been tested the most and has a success rate of approximately 43.24% (16/37). It has shown some potential for good outcomes.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to the blue button, it has not yielded any positive rewards.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like the blue and red buttons, it has not yielded any positive rewards.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Also has not yielded any positive rewards.

Given this analysis, the green button is the only one that has shown some positive outcomes, even though it has more bad outcomes than good. The other buttons have not shown any potential for good outcomes at all.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the green button.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Not a good choice since it has not yielded any positive rewards.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 47 times, 22 good outcomes, 25 bad outcomes.
   - This button has the most data and has yielded a good outcome approximately 46.8% of the time (22/47). This is the best-performing button so far.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to the blue button, it has not yielded any positive rewards.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like the blue and red buttons, it has not yielded any positive rewards.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Also has not yielded any positive rewards.

Given this analysis, the green button has the highest success rate based on the number of times it has been pressed and the outcomes observed. 

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the green button.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Not a good choice since it has only been pressed once and resulted in a bad outcome.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 87 times, 52 good outcomes, 35 bad outcomes.
   - This button has the most data and a success rate of approximately 59.8% (52 good outcomes out of 87 presses). This is the best-performing button so far.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to the blue button, it has not performed well.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Also not a good choice.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like the others, it has not performed well.

Given that the green button has the highest success rate and has been tested extensively, it is the most reliable choice. 

Therefore, I will choose the green button for the next press.
