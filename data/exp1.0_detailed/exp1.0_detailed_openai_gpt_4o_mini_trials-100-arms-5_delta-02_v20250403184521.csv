4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 41 times, 25 good outcomes, 16 bad outcomes.

From this summary, we can see that the blue, green, red, and yellow buttons have all performed poorly, yielding no good outcomes. In contrast, the purple button has shown a significant number of good outcomes (25 out of 41 presses), which indicates that it has a higher mean reward compared to the other buttons.

Given that the goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, the best strategy is to continue pressing the button that has yielded the best results so far. The purple button has demonstrated a positive performance, and it is reasonable to assume that it will continue to do so.

Therefore, the next button I will choose is the purple button.

- **Red button**: 1 press, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome
- **Yellow button**: 1 press, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome
- **Purple button**: 63 presses, 38 good outcomes, 25 bad outcomes

From this summary, we can see that the blue, green, red, and yellow buttons have all been pressed only once and have not yielded any good outcomes. Therefore, they are not promising options based on the current data.

On the other hand, the purple button has been pressed 63 times and has a success rate of approximately 60.32% (38 good outcomes out of 63 total presses). This is significantly better than the other buttons, which have not shown any positive results.

Given that the purple button has demonstrated a higher probability of yielding good outcomes, it is the most logical choice to maximize the total reward.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 74 times, 42 good outcomes, 32 bad outcomes.

From this summary, we can see that the blue, green, red, and yellow buttons have all been pressed only once and have not yielded any good outcomes. Therefore, they are not promising options.

On the other hand, the purple button has been pressed 74 times and has a success rate of 42 good outcomes out of 74 presses. This gives it a success rate of approximately 56.76% (42/74), which is significantly better than the other buttons.

Given that the purple button has shown a positive reward history, it is the best choice to maximize the total reward over the remaining time steps.

Thus, I will choose the purple button next.
