From the analysis, both the blue and green buttons have the same success rate of 0.33, while the red and yellow buttons have not yielded any good outcomes. The purple button has not been pressed at all, so we have no information about it.

Given that the blue and green buttons have shown some potential (even if limited), I will choose to press the **purple button** next. This is a strategic choice to explore a button that has not been tested yet, which could potentially yield better results.

1. **Blue Button**:

   - Good outcomes: 2

2. **Green Button**:

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0/1 = 0.0

From this analysis, the blue and green buttons have the highest success rates, with green being slightly better (0.316 vs. 0.286). The red, yellow, and purple buttons have not yielded any good outcomes yet, and they have only been pressed once each, which makes it difficult to assess their potential.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 7 times
   - Good outcomes: 2
   - Bad outcomes: 5
   - Success rate = 2/7 ≈ 0.286

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 46 times
   - Good outcomes: 18
   - Bad outcomes: 28
   - Success rate = 18/46 ≈ 0.391

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate = 0/1 = 0.0

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate = 0/1 = 0.0

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate = 0/1 = 0.0

From this analysis, the green button has the highest success rate (approximately 0.391) compared to the other buttons. The blue button has a lower success rate (approximately 0.286), and the red, yellow, and purple buttons have not shown any good outcomes yet.

Given that the green button has been pressed the most and has the best success rate, it would be the most logical choice to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the green button next.

Given that the green button has been pressed significantly more times, it may provide a more reliable estimate of its true mean reward. The other buttons (red, yellow, purple) have not shown any good outcomes and have only been pressed once, making them less favorable choices.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 7 times
   - Good outcomes: 2
   - Bad outcomes: 5
   - Success rate: 2/7 ≈ 0.286

2. **Green Button**:

   - Good outcomes: 31
   - Bad outcomes: 52
   - Success rate: 31/83 ≈ 0.373

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0/1 = 0

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0/1 = 0

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Good outcomes: 0
   - Bad outcomes: 1
   - Success rate: 0/1 = 0

From this analysis, the green button has the highest success rate (approximately 0.373) compared to the other buttons. The blue button has a lower success rate (approximately 0.286), and the red, yellow, and purple buttons have not shown any good outcomes yet.

Given that the green button has been pressed the most and has the best success rate, it would be the most logical choice to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the green button next.
