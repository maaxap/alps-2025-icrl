   - Pressed 6 times, 3 good outcomes, 3 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a 50% success rate as well, but it has been tested more times than the green button.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to the blue button, it has not shown any positive reward.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times, no data available.
   - This button has not been tested at all, so we have no information about its performance.

Given that both the green and red buttons have shown a 50% success rate, but the red button has been tested more times, it might be more reliable. However, the purple button has not been tested at all, which means it could potentially yield a good outcome since we have no negative data on it.

Considering the exploration-exploitation trade-off, it might be beneficial to try the purple button since it has not been tested yet and could provide new information about its performance.

Therefore, I will choose the purple button.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 16 times, 11 good outcomes, 5 bad outcomes.
   - This button has the highest success rate (approximately 68.75% good outcomes). It seems to be the best option so far.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 12 times, 5 good outcomes, 7 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a lower success rate (approximately 41.67% good outcomes). Not as favorable as the green button.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to the blue button, it has not yielded any good outcomes.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like the blue and yellow buttons, it has not yielded any good outcomes.

Given this analysis, the green button has the highest success rate and has provided the most good outcomes. Therefore, it is the best choice for the next press.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Not a good choice since it has only been pressed once and resulted in a bad outcome.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 26 times, 16 good outcomes, 10 bad outcomes.
   - This gives a success rate of approximately 61.54% (16/26). This is the highest success rate among the buttons.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 12 times, 5 good outcomes, 7 bad outcomes.
   - This gives a success rate of approximately 41.67% (5/12). This is lower than the green button.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to the blue button, not a good choice.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Also not a good choice.

Given this analysis, the green button has the highest success rate and has been pressed the most times, indicating that it is likely to yield a good reward based on past performance.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To decide which button to press next, let's analyze the data provided:

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Not a good choice since it has only produced bad outcomes.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 55 times, 35 good outcomes, 20 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a success rate of approximately 63.6% (35 good out of 55 total). This is the highest success rate among the buttons.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 12 times, 5 good outcomes, 7 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a success rate of approximately 41.7%, which is lower than the green button.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to the blue button, it has only produced bad outcomes.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like the blue and yellow buttons, it has only produced bad outcomes.

Given this analysis, the green button has the highest success rate and has been pressed the most times, indicating it is likely to yield a good reward based on past performance.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the green button.

   - Not a good choice since it has only been pressed once and resulted in a bad outcome.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 65 times, 42 good outcomes, 23 bad outcomes.
   - This button has the highest number of presses and a good success rate (approximately 64.6% good outcomes). This is a strong candidate.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 12 times, 5 good outcomes, 7 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a lower success rate (approximately 41.7% good outcomes). Not as promising as the green button.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to the blue button, it has only been pressed once and resulted in a bad outcome.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like the yellow and blue buttons, it has not shown any positive results.

Given this analysis, the green button has the best performance based on the number of trials and the proportion of good outcomes. Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the green button.

For each button, when you press it, you will get a reward that is sampled from the button's associated distribution. You have 100 time steps and, on each time step, you can choose any button and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps.

At each time step, I will show you a summary of your past choices and rewards. Then you must make the next choice, which must be exactly one of blue, red, green, yellow, purple.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Not a good choice since it has not yielded any positive rewards.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 75 times, 48 good outcomes, 27 bad outcomes.
   - This button has the highest number of good outcomes (48) and a relatively high success rate. The estimated probability of a good outcome is 48/75 = 0.64.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 12 times, 5 good outcomes, 7 bad outcomes.
   - The success rate is 5/12 ≈ 0.42, which is lower than the green button.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to the blue button, it has not yielded any positive rewards.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like the blue and yellow buttons, it has not yielded any positive rewards.

Given this analysis, the green button has the highest success rate and has been pressed the most times, indicating it is likely to yield the best reward based on past performance.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the green button.

   - This button has a lower success rate (approximately 41.7% good outcomes) compared to the green button.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to the blue button, it has only been pressed once and resulted in a bad outcome.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
