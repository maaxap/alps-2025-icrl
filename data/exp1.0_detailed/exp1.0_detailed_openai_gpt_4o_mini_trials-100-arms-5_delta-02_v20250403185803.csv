Given that the yellow button has the highest success rate based on the data we have, it would be the most logical choice to maximize the total reward. The other buttons (blue, green, red) have all resulted in bad outcomes, and the purple button has not been tested at all.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the yellow button.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 29 times, 17 good outcomes, 12 bad outcomes.
   - This button has shown a positive outcome rate of approximately 58.6% (17 good out of 29 total). This is significantly better than the other buttons.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times, 0 good outcomes, 0 bad outcomes.
   - Since this button has not been pressed at all, we have no information about its performance.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - This button has not shown any positive results.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to the blue button, this has also not shown any positive results.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like the previous buttons, this has not yielded any good outcomes.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 39 times, 21 good outcomes, 18 bad outcomes.
   - This button has shown a positive outcome rate of approximately 53.85% (21 good out of 39 total). This is significantly better than the other buttons.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times, 0 good outcomes, 0 bad outcomes.
   - This button has not been tested yet, so we have no information about its performance.

Given that the yellow button has the highest success rate based on the data we have, it would be the most logical choice to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome. This button has not shown any positive results.
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome. Similar to the blue button, this has also not shown any positive results.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome. This button also has not shown any positive results.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 49 times, 27 good outcomes, 22 bad outcomes. This button has a positive outcome rate of approximately 55% (27/49), which is significantly better than the other buttons.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times, no outcomes recorded. We have no information about this button's performance.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 69 times, 34 good outcomes, 35 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a history of providing some good outcomes (34 out of 69), which gives it a success rate of approximately 49.28%. This is the only button that has shown some positive reward.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times, 0 good outcomes, 0 bad outcomes.
   - This button has not been tested at all, so we have no information about its performance.

Given that the yellow button has the most data and has shown a near 50% success rate, it is the most reliable choice based on the information we have. The other buttons (blue, green, red) have all resulted in bad outcomes, and the purple button has not been tested.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the yellow button.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 79 times, 36 good outcomes, 43 bad outcomes.
   - This gives a success rate of approximately 45.57% (36 good out of 79 total). 
   - This button has been tested the most and has shown some level of success.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times, no data available.
   - We have no information about this button's performance.

Given that the yellow button has the most data and has shown some success, it seems to be the best option based on the information we have. The other buttons (blue, green, red) have not performed well, and the purple button has not been tested at all.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button for the next press.

Each button is associated with a Bernoulli distribution with a fixed but unknown mean; the means for the buttons could be different. For each button, when you press it, you will get a reward that is sampled from the button's associated distribution. You have 100 time steps and, on each time step, you can choose any button and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps.

At each time step, I will show you a summary of your past choices and rewards. Then you must make the next choice, which must be exactly one of blue, red, green, yellow, purple. Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.

- green button: pressed 1 times. Reward: 0 times gave good outcomes and 1 times gave bad outcomes 
- red button: pressed 1 times. Reward: 0 times gave good outcomes and 1 times gave bad outcomes

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Not a good choice since it has only produced bad outcomes.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to the blue button, it has only produced bad outcomes.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Like the previous two, it has only produced bad outcomes.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 89 times, 42 good outcomes, 47 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a success rate of approximately 47.19% (42 good out of 89 total). While it has produced more bad outcomes than good, it is the only button with a significant amount of data.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times, no data available.
   - We have no information about this button's performance.

Given that the yellow button has the most data and has produced some good outcomes, it is the most reliable choice based on the information we have. The other buttons (blue, green, red) have not shown any positive outcomes, and the purple button has no data at all.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the yellow button.
