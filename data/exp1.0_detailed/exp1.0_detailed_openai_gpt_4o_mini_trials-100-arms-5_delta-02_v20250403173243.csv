2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To decide which button to press next, let's analyze the data provided:

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Not a good choice since it has only produced bad outcomes.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to blue, it has only produced bad outcomes.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, 1 good outcome, 1 bad outcome.
   - This button has a 50% success rate, which is better than blue and green.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 4 times, 2 good outcomes, 2 bad outcomes.
   - This button also has a 50% success rate, similar to red.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 13 times, 9 good outcomes, 4 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a success rate of approximately 69.2% (9 out of 13), making it the best-performing button so far.

Given that the purple button has the highest success rate and has been pressed the most times, it is the most reliable choice based on the data we have.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To decide which button to press next, let's analyze the data provided:

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Not a good choice since it has not yielded any good outcomes.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to blue, it has not yielded any good outcomes.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, 1 good outcome, 1 bad outcome.
   - This button has a 50% success rate based on the limited data.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 4 times, 2 good outcomes, 2 bad outcomes.
   - This button also has a 50% success rate based on the data.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 23 times, 16 good outcomes, 7 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a success rate of approximately 69.57% (16 good out of 23 total).

Given this analysis, the purple button has the highest success rate and has been pressed the most times, indicating it is likely the best option based on the data we have.

Therefore, I will choose the purple button next.

   - Not a good choice since it has only produced bad outcomes.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, 0 good outcomes, 1 bad outcome.
   - Similar to blue, it has only produced bad outcomes.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, 1 good outcome, 1 bad outcome.
   - This button has a 50% success rate, which is better than blue and green.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 4 times, 2 good outcomes, 2 bad outcomes.
   - This button also has a 50% success rate, similar to red.

5. **Purple Button**:

   - Pressed 2 times, 1 good outcome, 1 bad outcome.
   - This button has a 50% success rate, but the sample size is small.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 4 times, 2 good outcomes, 2 bad outcomes.
   - This button also has a 50% success rate, but again, the sample size is small.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 43 times, 27 good outcomes, 16 bad outcomes.
   - This button has a success rate of approximately 62.79% (27/43), which is the highest among all buttons.

Given that the purple button has the highest success rate and has been tested the most, it is the best choice to maximize the total reward.
