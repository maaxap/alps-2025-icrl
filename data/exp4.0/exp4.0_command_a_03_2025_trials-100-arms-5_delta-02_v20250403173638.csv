In a bandit problem, the goal is to balance exploration (trying new buttons to gather information) and exploitation (choosing buttons that have already shown promise). Since we have only 100 time steps, it's crucial to explore early to gather more information about the buttons' rewards.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Current Information:** Blue and green buttons have been pressed once with no reward. Red, yellow, and purple buttons are unexplored.
2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Since we have limited information, exploring an unexplored button is a good strategy to gather more data.

Exploration involves trying out buttons that haven't been pressed yet to gather more information about their reward distributions. Exploitation involves pressing buttons that have already shown promising rewards to maximize immediate gains.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Observations**:  
   - The **red button** has been pressed once and yielded a reward of 1.0, which is the highest observed reward so far.  
   - The **blue** and **green buttons** have been pressed once each, but both yielded a reward of 0.0.  
   - The **yellow** and **purple buttons** have not been pressed yet, so their reward distributions are completely unknown.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - **Exploitation**: The red button has shown the highest reward, so pressing it again could yield another high reward.  
   - **Exploration**: The yellow and purple buttons are unexplored, and one of them might have an even higher reward than the red button.  

3. **Strategy at Early Stages**:  
   Since we are only at the 4th time step out of 100, it’s still early in the game. We should prioritize exploration to gather more information about the buttons, especially those that haven’t been pressed yet.

   - **Green button**: Highest average reward (0.5) with only 2 presses. It’s a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Exploration Strategy**:  
   - The **purple button** has been pressed the least (only 2 times), so we have the least information about it. Exploring it further could help us determine if it has a higher reward than currently observed.  
   - The **blue button** has been pressed 3 times with no reward, but it’s still worth considering for exploration since it hasn’t been ruled out completely.

3. **Decision**:

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Green button** has the highest average reward (0.625) and has been pressed 8 times, which is a good sample size to trust its average.  
   - **Blue button** has a lower average reward (0.25) but has only been pressed 4 times, so there’s still some uncertainty about its true mean.  
   - **Red and Yellow buttons** have the same average reward (0.3333) and have been pressed 3 times each, which is a small sample size.  
   - **Purple button** has the lowest average reward (0.0) and has been pressed 3 times, but it’s still worth exploring further since it hasn’t been pressed much.

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we have 100 time steps and are only at step 22, it’s still early in the process. We should prioritize exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to better understand their potential rewards.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Green button** is the best for exploitation, but we should explore **Red**, **Yellow**, or **Purple** to reduce uncertainty.  
   - Among **Red**, **Yellow**, and **Purple**, **Purple** has the lowest average reward but has been pressed the least (3 times), so it’s a good candidate for exploration.

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **green button** has the highest average reward (0.625) and has been pressed 8 times, which is a reasonable number of trials to estimate its mean.  
   - Other buttons like red and yellow have similar average rewards but fewer trials, so there’s potential for higher rewards if their true means are higher.  
   - The **purple button** has the lowest average reward and has been pressed 4 times, so it’s unlikely to be the best choice.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Option (Exploitation):**  
   The **green button** has the highest average reward (0.6) based on 10 presses. This suggests it might be the best button so far.

2. **Exploration Needs:**  
   - The **red** and **yellow** buttons have been pressed only 3 times each, with average rewards of 0.3333. These buttons could potentially have higher means, but we need more data to confirm.  
   - The **blue** button has been pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.25, which is lower than green but still worth considering for exploration.  
   - The **purple** button has been pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.0, making it the least promising option so far.

3. **Balancing Exploitation and Exploration:**  
   Since we have 76 time steps remaining, we can afford to explore further. However, the **green button** is clearly the best option based on current data, and pressing it again will likely yield a good reward.

4. **Decision:**  
   Given the high average reward of the green button and the need to maximize immediate rewards, we should prioritize exploitation over exploration at this stage.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Green button** has the highest average reward (0.6875) and has been pressed 16 times, indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Blue button** has a moderate average reward (0.25) but has only been pressed 4 times, so it might be worth exploring further.

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we still have 70 time steps left, it’s beneficial to explore the buttons with fewer presses to better understand their reward distributions. However, we should not completely ignore the green button, as it has shown the highest reward so far.

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Green button** is the best exploitative choice.  
   - **Red and Yellow buttons** are good exploratory choices due to their moderate rewards and fewer presses.  
   - **Blue button** is also a reasonable exploratory choice.  
   - **Purple button** is the least promising and should be avoided unless we need to confirm its low reward.

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, the **green button** remains the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward, while still leaving room for exploration in future steps.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **green button** has the highest average reward (0.7059) based on 17 presses, making it the most promising choice for exploitation.  
   - The **blue button** has a moderate average reward (0.25) but has only been pressed 4 times, so it might be worth exploring further.  
   - The **red** and **yellow buttons** have similar average rewards (0.3333) but have only been pressed 3 times each, so they could also benefit from more exploration.  
   - The **purple button** has an average reward of 0.0 after 4 presses, making it the least promising.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   - While the green button is the best known option, the red and yellow buttons have been pressed fewer times and could potentially yield higher rewards. Exploring them further is a good strategy.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the limited exploration of the **red** and **yellow buttons**, it’s reasonable to explore one of them next. Since they have the same average reward, we can choose either.

1. **Exploitation**: The **green button** has the highest average reward (0.631578947368421) based on 19 presses. This suggests it might be the best button to maximize immediate rewards.

2. **Exploration**: The **yellow button** has a promising average reward (0.5) but has only been pressed 4 times. It might be worth exploring further to confirm if it’s a better option than the green button.

3. **Other Buttons**: The **blue** and **red buttons** have the same low average reward (0.25), and the **purple button** has the lowest average reward (0.0). These buttons are less promising and should be explored only if we have strong reason to believe their rewards might improve.

4. **Strategy**: Given that we have 65 time steps remaining, we should prioritize buttons with high potential rewards. The **green button** is the most reliable choice so far, but the **yellow button** warrants further exploration due to its promising average reward and limited data.

**Decision**: Since the **green button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be somewhat reliable, it’s the best choice for exploitation.

1. **Current Performance**:  
   - **Green button** has the highest average reward (0.625) and has been pressed the most (24 times), indicating it’s the most reliable choice so far.  
   - **Yellow button** has a moderate average reward (0.4) but has been pressed fewer times (5), so there’s still uncertainty about its true mean.  
   - **Blue and Red buttons** have the same low average reward (0.25) and have been pressed equally (4 times), but their true means could still be higher.  
   - **Purple button** has the lowest average reward (0.0) and has been pressed 4 times, suggesting it’s likely a poor choice.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - We’ve already explored the **purple button** enough, and its performance is consistently poor, so it’s unlikely to be optimal.  
   - The **blue and red buttons** have been explored minimally, but their average rewards are low, and the **green button** is already performing well.  
   - The **yellow button** has potential but needs more exploration to confirm its true mean.  

3. **Best Strategy**:  
   - **Exploit the green button** since it has the highest average reward and is the most reliable choice so far.  
   - Alternatively, **explore the yellow button** further to reduce uncertainty about its true mean, as it could potentially outperform the green button.  

Given the goal is to maximize total reward over 100 time steps, and we’ve already explored the yellow button somewhat, the **green button** remains the safest and most rewarding choice at this stage.

   - **Blue**, **Red**, and **Purple** have lower averages and fewer trials, but they could still have higher true means (exploration is needed).  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since **Green** has the highest average and a good number of trials, it’s the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
   - However, **Yellow** has fewer trials and a decent average, so exploring it further could be beneficial.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Green button**: Has the highest average reward (0.6176) and has been pressed 34 times. This is the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
   - **Yellow button**: Has a moderate average reward (0.4) and has been pressed only 5 times. There’s potential for higher rewards, but it’s less certain.  
   - **Blue and Red buttons**: Both have the same low average reward (0.25) and have been pressed 4 times each. They seem less promising.  
   - **Purple button**: Has the lowest average reward (0.0) and has been pressed 4 times. It’s the least promising option.  

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - The green button is the best choice for exploitation, but we should also explore other buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options.  
   - The yellow button is a good candidate for exploration since it has a moderate reward and has been pressed fewer times compared to the green button.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given that we have 49 remaining time steps, we can afford to explore a bit more. However, the green button is still the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

1. **Current Performance**:  
   - **Green button** has the highest average reward (0.6286) and has been pressed the most (35 times), indicating it’s the most reliable choice so far.  
   - **Yellow button** has a moderate average reward (0.4) but has been pressed only 5 times, so its true mean is less certain.  
   - **Blue and Red buttons** have the same low average reward (0.25) and have been pressed 4 times each, but their true means are still uncertain.  
   - **Purple button** has the lowest average reward (0.0) and has been pressed 4 times, making it the least promising option.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - **Green button** is the best-performing option, but we should also explore other buttons to confirm their true means, especially **Yellow**, **Blue**, and **Red**, which have been pressed fewer times.  
   - **Purple button** is unlikely to be optimal given its poor performance so far.

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Green button** is the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
   - **Yellow button** is worth exploring further due to its moderate reward and limited data.  
   - **Blue and Red buttons** could also be explored, but their low rewards so far make them less appealing.  

Given the goal of maximizing total reward over 100 time steps, the **Green button** remains the best choice due to its high average reward and reliability.

1. **Current Best Performer**: The green button has the highest average reward (0.575) and has been pressed 40 times. This suggests it is a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Exploration of Under-sampled Buttons**: The blue, red, yellow, and purple buttons have been pressed fewer times (5, 4, 6, and 5 times respectively).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The **green button** has the highest average reward (0.5854) and has been pressed 41 times. It’s the most reliable choice for exploitation.

2. **Exploration Opportunities**:
   - The **blue button** has a decent average reward (0.4) but has only been pressed 5 times. It could be worth exploring further.
   - The **red button** has a low average reward (0.25) and has been pressed only 4 times. It might still have potential, but it’s less promising than blue.
   - The **yellow button** has an average reward of 0.3333 and has been pressed 6 times. It’s not as promising as blue but could still be explored.
   - The **purple button** has an average reward of 0.0 and has been pressed 5 times. It’s the least promising and likely not worth further exploration.

3. **Decision**:
   - The **green button** is the safest choice for exploitation, but we’re only 61 time steps in, and there’s still room for exploration.
   - The **blue button** has shown potential with a decent average reward and fewer presses, making it a good candidate for exploration.

Given the balance between exploration and exploitation, and considering the remaining time steps (39), it’s reasonable to explore the **blue button** further to confirm its potential.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Green button** has the highest average reward (0.5869565217391305) and has been pressed the most (46 times), indicating it’s likely the best option based on current data.  
   - **Blue button** has a moderate average reward (0.2857142857142857) but has been pressed only 7 times, so there’s still some uncertainty about its true mean.  
   - **Yellow button** has a decent average reward (0.3333333333333333) but has been pressed only 6 times, so it’s worth exploring further.  
   - **Red button** has a low average reward (0.2) and has been pressed only 5 times, so it’s less promising but still worth exploring slightly.  
   - **Purple button** has an average reward of 0.0 and has been pressed 6 times, making it the least promising option.

2. **Decision**:  
   - Given the remaining 30 time steps, the **green button** is the safest choice for exploitation since it has the highest average reward and has been sufficiently explored.  
   - However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options, we should allocate a few trials to **blue** and **yellow** buttons for further exploration.  

3. **Final Choice**:  
   Since the **green button** has the highest average reward and has been well-explored, it’s the best choice to maximize immediate rewards while still leaving room for exploration in later steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **green button** has the highest average reward (0.5957) and has been pressed the most (47 times). It’s the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: The **red**, **yellow**, and **purple** buttons have been pressed fewer times (5, 6, and 6 times, respectively). Their average rewards are lower, but we don’t have enough data to be certain about their true means. The **purple button** has an average reward of 0.0, but it’s possible its true mean is higher than what we’ve observed so far.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re at time step 72 out of 100, we still have some room for exploration. However, the **green button** is significantly outperforming the others, so it’s a strong candidate.

4. **Decision**: Given the high reward of the **green button** and the limited time left, it’s best to continue exploiting it while occasionally exploring other buttons. However, for this step, the **green button** is the most promising choice.

   - The **blue button** has a lower average reward (0.2857) but has been pressed only 7 times, so its true mean could be higher.  
   - The **yellow button** has a moderate average reward (0.3333) with only 6 presses, so it might be worth exploring further.  
   - The **red button** has a low average reward (0.2) with only 5 presses, but it’s still worth considering for exploration.  
   - The **purple button** has an average reward of 0.0 with 6 presses, making it the least promising option.  

2. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 22 time steps left (100 - 78 = 22), we should prioritize exploitation while still exploring buttons with moderate potential.  
   - The **green button** is the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward, but we should also consider exploring the **blue** or **yellow** buttons to confirm their potential.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high average reward of the **green button** and the limited time left, it’s the best choice to maximize total reward.

### Analysis:
1. **Green Button**:  
   - Pressed 55 times with an average reward of **0.6363636363636364**.  
   - This is the highest average reward so far, making it the best choice for exploitation.

3. **Yellow Button**:  
   - Pressed 6 times with an average reward of **0.3333333333333333**.  
   - Slightly better than the blue button but still lower than the green button.

4. **Red Button**:  
   - Pressed 5 times with an average reward of **0.2**.  
   - Lower average reward and not worth exploring further given the limited time steps.

5. **Purple Button**:  
   - Pressed 6 times with an average reward of **0.0**.  
   - No reward at all, so it’s not worth exploring further.

### Decision:
Given the limited time steps (21 remaining), the **green button** is the best choice for exploitation, as it has the highest average reward and is the most reliable option to maximize total reward. While exploration could reveal higher rewards for under-explored buttons, the risk is not worth it at this stage.

   - **Green button** has the highest average reward (0.631578947368421) and has been pressed the most (57 times), indicating it is likely the best button so far.

1. **Current Best Option (Exploitation):**  
   The **green button** has the highest average reward (0.6207) and has been pressed the most (58 times), indicating a relatively stable estimate of its mean. This is the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration of Under-Explored Buttons:**  
   The **blue**, **red**, **yellow**, and **purple** buttons have been pressed fewer times (7, 5, 6, and 6 times, respectively). Their average rewards are lower, but their means are less certain due to fewer samples.  
   - **Purple** has an average reward of 0.0, but it’s based on only 6 trials, so its true mean could be higher.  
   - **Red** has an average reward of 0.2, but it’s based on only 5 trials, so its true mean could be higher.  
   - **Yellow** has an average reward of 0.3333, but it’s based on only 6 trials, so its true mean could be higher.  
   - **Blue** has an average reward of 0.2857, but it’s based on only 7 trials, so its true mean could be higher.

3. **Balancing Exploitation and Exploration:**  
   With only 18 time steps left, the focus should be on **exploitation** since the green button has a high and stable reward. Exploring under-explored buttons is risky because their true means are unlikely to surpass the green button’s mean, given the limited time remaining.

   Given the remaining 13 time steps, the best strategy is to focus on the button with the highest observed reward (green) while also considering the possibility of further exploration. However, since the green button has already been pressed many times and consistently yields a high reward, it’s the safest and most rewarding choice.

1. **Current Best Option (Exploitation):**  
   The **green button** has the highest average reward (0.6363636363636364) based on 66 presses. This suggests it is the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

   - Average reward: 0.2857  
   - Lower than the yellow button and significantly lower than the green button.

4. **Red Button**:  
   - Pressed 5 times  
   - Average reward: 0.2  
   - Lower than the blue and yellow buttons.

5. **Purple Button**:  
   - Pressed 6 times  
   - Average reward: 0.0  
   - No reward at all, so this is the least favorable option.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward and a relatively large number of trials, it is the most reliable choice to maximize the reward in the remaining time steps.

Each button is associated with a Bernoulli distribution with a fixed but unknown mean; the means for the buttons could be different. For each button, when you press it, you will get a reward that is sampled from the button's associated distribution. You have 100 time steps and, on each time step, you can choose any button and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to choose the button that has the highest expected reward based on the information we have so far. Let's analyze the data:

1. **Green Button**:  
   - Pressed 74 times  
   - Average reward: 0.5945945945945946  
   - This is the highest average reward among all buttons, indicating that the green button is the most promising choice.

2. **Yellow Button**:  
   - Pressed 6 times  
   - Average reward: 0.3333333333333333  
   - While this is a decent reward, it is significantly lower than the green button.

3. **Blue Button**:  
   - Pressed 7 times  
   - Average reward: 0.2857142857142857  
   - This is lower than both the green and yellow buttons.

4. **Red Button**:  
   - Pressed 5 times  
   - Average reward: 0.2  
   - This is the second-lowest average reward.

5. **Purple Button**:  
   - Pressed 6 times  
   - Average reward: 0.0  
   - This button has yielded no reward so far, making it the least promising choice.

Given that we have only 2 time steps left and the green button has consistently provided the highest average reward, it is the best choice to maximize our total reward.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to choose the button with the highest expected reward based on the observed data. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the average rewards for each button**:
   - **Blue**: 0.2857 (7 presses)
   - **Green**: 0.6 (75 presses)
   - **Red**: 0.2 (5 presses)
   - **Yellow**: 0.3333 (6 presses)
   - **Purple**: 0.0 (6 presses)

2. **Identify the button with the highest average reward**:
   - The **green button** has the highest average reward of 0.6.

3. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**:
   - Since this is the 100th and final time step, the focus should be on **exploitation** (choosing the button with the highest known reward) rather than exploration (trying less-pressed buttons to gather more data).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The **green button** is the best choice to maximize the total reward.
