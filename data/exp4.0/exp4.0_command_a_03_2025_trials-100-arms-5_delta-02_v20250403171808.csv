Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Observations**:
   - **Purple button**: Pressed 4 times, average reward 1.0. This is the highest average reward so far.
   - **Yellow button**: Pressed 3 times, average reward 0.6666. This is the second-highest average reward.

   - **Red button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0. Similar to the green button, it’s been pressed only once.

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:
   - **Exploitation**: Based on current data, the purple button has the highest average reward, so pressing it again is a safe bet to maximize immediate reward.
   - **Exploration**: The green and red buttons have been pressed only once and have not yielded any reward. There’s a chance they might have higher rewards, so exploring them could be beneficial in the long run.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given that we have 100 time steps and we’ve only used 11 so far, we still have plenty of time to explore. However, the purple button has shown consistently high rewards, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - To balance exploitation and exploration, we should prioritize the purple button for now, as it has the highest proven reward, but keep in mind to explore the less-pressed buttons (green and red) in future steps.

2. **Blue, Red, and Yellow Buttons**: Each has been pressed a few times (2, 2, and 4 respectively) with an average reward of 0.5. These buttons have shown potential but with less certainty due to fewer trials.

3. **Green Button**: Pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0. This is the least explored button, but its single trial resulted in no reward, which is not encouraging.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **purple button** has the highest average reward (0.9) and has been pressed 10 times, which is a decent number of trials. It seems like a safe bet for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: The **green button** has only been pressed once and has an average reward of 0.0. This is a very small sample size, so its true reward potential is still highly uncertain. Exploring it further could reveal a higher reward.

3. **Other Buttons**:
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of 0.667 with 3 presses. It’s a decent option but not as high as purple.
   - **Red button**: Average reward of 0.5 with 2 presses. Not very promising.
   - **Yellow button**: Average reward of 0.5 with 4 presses. Also not very promising.

Given that we’re only 20 time steps in (out of 100), there’s still room for exploration. However, the **purple button** is clearly the best-performing option so far, and exploiting it seems like the most reliable way to maximize rewards.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Purple button** has the highest average reward (0.8333) and has been pressed 12 times, indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Blue button** has a high average reward (0.6666) but has only been pressed 3 times, suggesting it could be worth exploring further.

   - **Red button** and **Yellow button** have moderate average rewards (0.5) and have been pressed 2 and 4 times, respectively. They are less promising than purple and blue but could still be explored.

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   - The **green button** has been pressed only once and has an average reward of 0.0. This is a very small sample size, and it’s possible that its true reward is higher. Exploring it further could provide valuable information.  
   - The **blue button** has a high average reward but has only been pressed 3 times. Exploring it further could confirm its high reward potential.

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high uncertainty around the **green button** and its low average reward, it’s a good candidate for exploration to gather more data.  
   - However, the **blue button** also deserves exploration due to its high average reward and limited data.  

Since the **green button** has the least data and could potentially have a higher reward than currently observed, it’s a good choice for exploration.

   - **Blue, Red, Yellow buttons**: Each pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.5. These buttons have shown moderate rewards but haven't been explored extensively.
   - **Green button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.0. This button has shown no reward so far, but it hasn’t been explored much.
   - **Red button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. Similar to blue and yellow, it has moderate rewards but limited exploration.

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:
   - **Purple button** is the clear leader in terms of average reward, so exploiting it further seems like a good strategy.
   - However, **blue, red, and yellow buttons** have been pressed only 4 times each, which is not enough to confidently conclude their true reward potential. Exploring these buttons a bit more could be beneficial.
   - **Green button** has been pressed only twice and has shown no reward, but it’s worth exploring further to confirm if it’s truly a low-reward button.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given that **purple** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, it’s a safe choice for exploitation.
   - However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing **blue, red, or yellow** to gather more data. Since they have the same average reward (0.5) and have been pressed equally, we can choose one of them randomly or systematically.
   - **Green** is a high-risk, high-reward choice since it hasn’t been explored much and has shown no reward so far.

4. **Final Choice**:
   - **Purple** is the most reliable choice based on current data, but to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should also explore **blue, red, or yellow**.
   - Given the limited exploration of **blue, red, and yellow**, let’s choose one of them to gather more data.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Current Best Performers:**
   - **Purple button:** Pressed 19 times with an average reward of 0.8421. This is the highest average reward so far, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Blue button:** Pressed 5 times with an average reward of 0.6. This is also a good performer but has been pressed fewer times compared to purple.

2. **Under-Explored Buttons:**
   - **Green button:** Pressed only 2 times with an average reward of 0.0. This button has the lowest average reward but has been pressed the least, so it might be worth exploring further.
   - **Red button:** Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. Similar to green, it’s under-explored but has shown some potential.
   - **Yellow button:** Pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.5. It’s slightly more explored than red and green but still has room for more exploration.

3. **Strategy:**
   - **Exploitation vs. Exploration:** Given that we have 68 time steps remaining, we can afford to explore under-explored buttons while still exploiting the best-performing ones.
   - **Priority:** Since purple has the highest average reward and has been pressed a significant number of times, it’s a safe bet for exploitation. However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should also explore the under-explored ones.

4. **Decision:**
   - **Purple button** is the current best performer, but to ensure we’re not overlooking better options, let’s explore one of the under-explored buttons.
   - **Green button** has the lowest average reward but has been pressed the least, making it a good candidate for exploration.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The **purple button** has the highest average reward (0.8421) and has been pressed 19 times. This suggests it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Exploration Needs**: The **green button** has been pressed only 3 times and has an average reward of 0.0. This could be due to bad luck or genuinely low reward. It’s worth exploring further to confirm its performance.

3. **Other Buttons**:
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of 0.6 with 5 presses. It’s a decent option but not as good as purple.
   - **Red button**: Average reward of 0.5 with 2 presses. Limited data, but not promising so far.
   - **Yellow button**: Average reward of 0.5 with 4 presses. Similar to red, not very promising.

4. **Decision**: While purple is the best performer so far, we should allocate some trials to explore the green button, as it has been under-explored and could potentially yield higher rewards than expected.

   The **purple button** has the highest average reward (0.7273) and has been pressed the most (22 times). This suggests it’s a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration Needs:**  
   - The **red button** has only been pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is a relatively low sample size, so its true reward potential is still uncertain.  
   - The **blue button** has been pressed 5 times with an average reward of 0.6, which is close to the purple button’s average. It might be worth exploring further.  
   - The **green** and **yellow** buttons have lower average rewards (0.25 and 0.5, respectively) and have been pressed enough times to suggest they are less promising.

3. **Decision:**  
   While the purple button is the safest choice for immediate reward, exploring the **red button** could reveal a higher reward potential, as it has been under-explored. Given the limited time steps remaining (63 out of 100), it’s worth taking a calculated risk to maximize long-term rewards.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Current Best Option (Exploitation):**  
   The purple button has the highest average reward (0.7097) based on 31 presses. This suggests it is the most promising button so far.

2. **Exploration Consideration:**  
   The blue button has a high average reward (0.5) but has only been pressed 6 times, which is fewer than the purple button. This means there is still uncertainty about its true reward distribution.  
   The green, red, and yellow buttons have lower average rewards and fewer presses, so they are less promising but still worth considering for exploration.

3. **Strategy:**  
   Since we are only at 49 out of 100 time steps, we still have room for exploration. However, the purple button’s high reward and significant number of presses make it a strong candidate for exploitation. To maximize total reward, we should prioritize the purple button while occasionally exploring others, especially the blue button, which shows potential.

4. **Decision:**  
   Given the high reward and reliability of the purple button, it is the best choice for this step.

   The **purple button** has the highest average reward (0.735) and has been pressed the most (34 times). This suggests it’s a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

However, since purple has consistently performed well, it remains a strong candidate for exploitation.

4. **Decision**: For this step, let's prioritize exploitation to maximize immediate reward while keeping in mind the need for further exploration in subsequent steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate Average Rewards**:  
   - **Purple**: 0.75 (highest average reward, pressed 40 times)  
   - **Blue**: 0.5714 (second-highest average reward, pressed 7 times)  
   - **Yellow**: 0.4 (pressed 5 times)  
   - **Red**: 0.3333 (pressed 3 times)  
   - **Green**: 0.25 (lowest average reward, pressed 4 times)  

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Purple** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, so it’s a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - **Blue** has a high average reward but fewer presses, so it could be worth exploring further.  
   - **Red**, **Yellow**, and **Green** have lower average rewards and fewer presses, so they are less promising for exploitation but could still be explored.  

3. **Decision**:  
   Given that **Purple** has the highest average reward and has been pressed significantly more than the others, it is the best choice for maximizing immediate reward. However, to balance exploration, we could occasionally try **Blue** or other buttons with fewer presses. But for now, **Purple** is the optimal choice.

1. **Current Best Performer**: The purple button has the highest average reward (0.7317) and has been pressed the most (41 times). This suggests it is a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While purple seems the best, we should also consider exploring other buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options. The blue button has a high average reward (0.5714) but has only been pressed 7 times, which is relatively few compared to purple.

   - **Yellow**: 0.4 (5 presses)
   - **Purple**: 0.7391 (46 presses)

2. **Observation**:
   - **Purple** has the highest average reward (0.7391) and has been pressed the most (46 times), indicating it’s a strong candidate.
   - **Red** has a high average reward (0.5) but has been pressed only 4 times, so its estimate might be less reliable compared to Purple.
   - **Blue** has a moderate average reward (0.4444) but has been pressed 9 times, making its estimate more reliable than Red or Yellow.
   - **Green** and **Yellow** have lower average rewards and fewer presses, making them less attractive.

3. **Strategy**:
   - **Exploitation vs. Exploration**: Since Purple has the highest average reward and a relatively large number of presses, it’s a safe choice for exploitation.
   - However, Red has a promising average reward but fewer presses, so exploring it further could be beneficial if Purple’s reward starts to decline.

4. **Decision**:
   - Given the limited time steps remaining (32 out of 100), prioritizing the button with the highest proven reward (Purple) is the best strategy to maximize total reward.

   - **Green** has the lowest average reward (0.25) and limited data.

3. **Strategy**:
   - **Exploitation**: Purple is the best-performing button so far, so pressing it again maximizes expected reward.
   - **Exploration**: Red has potential but needs more data. However, with only 31 time steps left, exploring less-pressed buttons (like Red) is risky unless Purple's performance drops.

4. **Decision**:
   - Purple remains the optimal choice due to its high average reward and sufficient data. Exploring other buttons is not worth the risk at this stage.

   - Given that we have 23 time steps left (100 - 77 = 23), we should focus on maximizing our total reward. The **purple button** has consistently given the highest rewards, so it’s the best choice for exploitation.
   - However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially higher rewards from the **red button**, we could allocate a few more presses to it. But for this step, since the **purple button** has proven to be the most reliable, we’ll stick with it.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Current Best Performers**:
   - **Purple button**: Pressed 54 times with an average reward of 0.7222. This is the highest average reward so far, but it has been pressed the most, so its estimate is likely more stable.
   - **Red button**: Pressed 6 times with an average reward of 0.6667. This is the second-highest average reward, but it has been pressed much less, so there’s more uncertainty about its true mean.

2. **Under-Explored Buttons**:
   - **Blue button**: Pressed 9 times with an average reward of 0.4444. It has a decent average reward but hasn’t been pressed as much as purple.
   - **Green button**: Pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.25. This is the lowest average reward so far, but it’s also the least explored.
   - **Yellow button**: Pressed 5 times with an average reward of 0.4. Similar to blue, it has a moderate average reward but hasn’t been pressed much.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - **Exploitation**: Choosing the purple button again is a safe bet since it has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, making its estimate more reliable.
   - **Exploration**: Choosing the red button could be beneficial because it has a high average reward but hasn’t been pressed much, so there’s potential for it to be even better than purple. Similarly, exploring the blue or yellow buttons could reveal higher rewards than currently estimated.

4. **Decision**:
   - Given that we have only 22 time steps left (100 - 78 = 22), we should prioritize exploitation to maximize total reward, but also consider exploring the red button a bit more since it has shown promising results with limited data.

**Final Decision**:  
Given the high average reward of the purple button and the limited time left, it’s the safest choice to maximize total reward. However, to balance exploration, we could consider pressing the red button a few more times in the remaining steps. For this step, we’ll stick with the highest proven performer.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Current Best Performers**:
   - **Purple button**: Pressed 55 times with an average reward of 0.727. This is the highest average reward so far, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.

   - **Green button**: Pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.25. This is the lowest average reward so far, but it’s also the least explored.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - Given that we have only 21 time steps left (100 - 79 = 21), we should focus more on exploiting the buttons with the highest known rewards while still exploring under-explored buttons to a lesser extent.
   - **Purple** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, so it’s a safe bet for exploitation.
   - **Red** has a high average reward but fewer samples, so it’s worth exploring further, but not as much as purple.

4. **Decision**:
   - Since **purple** has the highest average reward and has been sufficiently explored, it’s the best choice for exploitation at this stage.
   - However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially higher rewards from under-explored buttons, we should allocate a small portion of the remaining steps to explore **red** and **blue**.

Given the above analysis, the best choice for the next step is to press the **purple** button to maximize the expected reward while still considering exploration in subsequent steps.

   - **Blue** and **Yellow** have moderate average rewards and have been pressed a moderate number of times.
   - **Green** has the lowest average reward and has been pressed the least, making it a candidate for exploration.

3. **Remaining Time Steps:**
   - We have 14 time steps left (100 - 86 = 14).

4. **Strategy:**
   - Given the limited time, we should focus on exploiting the button with the highest average reward (Purple) while allocating a few trials to explore the buttons with fewer presses but potentially higher rewards (Red and possibly Blue or Yellow).

5. **Decision:**
   - **Purple** is the most reliable choice based on current data, but to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options, we should allocate a few trials to **Red**.

However, since we only have 14 steps left and **Purple** has consistently shown the highest reward, it’s prudent to continue exploiting it for the majority of the remaining steps.

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration:**

   - **Red** has a high average reward (0.5555555555555556) but has been pressed only 9 times, suggesting it might be worth exploring further.
   - **Blue** has a moderate average reward (0.4444444444444444) and has been pressed 9 times, similar to Red.
   - **Yellow** and **Green** have lower average rewards and have been pressed fewer times, making them candidates for exploration.

3. **Decision:**
   - Given that we have only 13 time steps left (100 - 87 = 13), the focus should be on maximizing immediate rewards while still considering exploration for buttons with high potential but fewer presses.
   - **Purple** is the safest bet for immediate reward maximization due to its high average reward and consistent performance.
   - **Red** is a close second and could be worth exploring further, but with only 13 steps left, the risk of not gaining enough information to justify switching might outweigh the potential reward.

Considering the above analysis, the best choice to maximize the total reward in the remaining time steps is to continue exploiting the **Purple** button, as it has consistently provided the highest rewards.

2. **Second Best Performer**: The red button has the second-highest average reward (0.5556) but has only been pressed 9 times. This indicates it might be worth exploring further to confirm its potential.

1. **Current Best Option Based on Average Reward**:  
   The purple button has the highest average reward (0.6774) and has been pressed the most (62 times), making its estimate relatively reliable.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   While purple seems the best, buttons like green (pressed only 4 times) and yellow (pressed 5 times) have fewer samples, so their true means might be higher than their current averages. However, with only 11 time steps left, exploring these buttons is risky unless their potential upside is significant.  

3. **Comparing Alternatives**:  
   - **Red**: Average reward of 0.5556 (pressed 9 times) is lower than purple but more reliable than green or yellow.  
   - **Blue**: Average reward of 0.4444 (pressed 9 times) is also lower than purple.  
   - **Green**: Average reward of 0.25 (pressed 4 times) is the lowest, but its true mean could be higher.

   - **Green** (0.25, 4 presses) has the lowest average reward and is not a good choice.

4. **Strategy for Remaining Steps**: Given only 5 time steps left, we should prioritize buttons with high expected rewards and low uncertainty. The **purple button** is the safest choice, but the **red button** offers a good balance of high reward and potential for improvement due to fewer presses.

**Decision**: To maximize the total reward, we’ll choose the **purple button** because it has the highest average reward and is the most reliable choice with the remaining time.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 4 time steps, we should focus on the buttons with the highest average rewards so far, while also considering the uncertainty around the less-pressed buttons. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the average rewards**:  
   - **Purple**: 0.6957 (highest average, but pressed 69 times, so its mean is likely well-estimated).  
   - **Red**: 0.5556 (second-highest average, pressed only 9 times, so there’s more uncertainty and potential for higher reward).  
   - **Blue**: 0.4444 (pressed 9 times, moderate average).  
   - **Yellow**: 0.4 (pressed 5 times, moderate average).  
   - **Green**: 0.25 (lowest average, pressed 4 times, but still some uncertainty).  

2. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**:  
   - **Purple** is the safest choice due to its high average reward and large sample size.  
   - **Red** has a high average reward but fewer presses, so it could be even better than estimated.  

3. **Decision**:  
   Given the remaining 4 time steps, we should prioritize buttons with high potential rewards. **Red** has a high average and fewer presses, making it a good candidate for exploration and potential exploitation.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to consider both the average rewards of the buttons we've already pressed and the uncertainty associated with the buttons that have been pressed fewer times. Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Average Rewards**:
   - **Purple**: 0.69565 (pressed 69 times)
   - **Red**: 0.6 (pressed 10 times)
   - **Blue**: 0.44444 (pressed 9 times)
   - **Yellow**: 0.4 (pressed 5 times)
   - **Green**: 0.25 (pressed 4 times)

2. **Uncertainty and Exploration**:
   - **Purple** has been pressed the most and has a high average reward, but its value is relatively well-estimated due to the high number of presses.
   - **Red** has a high average reward but has been pressed only 10 times, so there is still some uncertainty about its true mean.
   - **Blue**, **Yellow**, and **Green** have been pressed fewer times and have lower average rewards, but there is more uncertainty about their true means.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Given that we only have 3 time steps left, the focus should be on maximizing the expected reward rather than exploring further.
   - **Purple** has the highest average reward and is the most reliable choice based on the data.

Therefore, the best choice to maximize the total reward in the remaining time steps is to press the **purple** button.

**Key Observations**:  
- The **purple button** has the highest average reward (0.6901) and has been pressed the most (71 times), indicating it is likely the best option.  
- The **red button** has a high average reward (0.6) but has been pressed fewer times (10), suggesting it might still be worth exploring further.  
- The other buttons (blue, green, yellow) have lower average rewards and are less promising.  

**Decision**:  
Given that this is the **100th and final time step**, the goal is to maximize the total reward. The **purple button** has consistently provided the highest average reward, and there is no strong reason to switch to another button at this stage.
