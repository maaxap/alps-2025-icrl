A common strategy in such scenarios is to use an **exploration-exploitation** approach, where we initially explore all options to gather information before exploiting the best-performing option.

Given that all buttons have been pressed 0 times, we can start by arbitrarily choosing any button. To ensure fairness and systematic exploration, we can select the buttons in a predefined order, such as alphabetically.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. No data is available for any button, so all buttons are equally unknown.
2. Start with the first button in alphabetical order to systematically explore.
3. The first button alphabetically is **blue**.

- Since the red button has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of presses, it's a strong candidate for exploitation.
- However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing buttons like green or purple, which have been pressed only once and might have higher rewards that we haven't discovered yet.

Given the goal is to maximize total reward over 100 time steps, and considering the current data, the best choice for now is to exploit the red button while keeping in mind the need for further exploration in later steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Red button**: Pressed 10 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is the most explored button and has a consistent reward, making it a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - **Blue and Yellow buttons**: Both pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. These buttons show potential but need more exploration to confirm their true reward rates.  
   - **Green and Purple buttons**: Both pressed only 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons are the least explored and could have higher rewards, so they are good candidates for exploration.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we have 100 time steps and have only used 16 so far, it’s still early in the process. Exploring less-pressed buttons (Green and Purple) is crucial to gather more data and potentially find a better option than the Red button.  

3. **Choosing Between Green and Purple**:  
   Both have the same average reward (0.0) and have been pressed only once. Since there’s no additional information to differentiate them, we can choose either. For simplicity, let’s choose **Green** next.

   - The green and purple buttons have low average rewards (0.0), but they have been pressed fewer times (2 and 1, respectively), so their true means might still be uncertain.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since the red, blue, and yellow buttons have the same average reward, we should prioritize exploring the buttons with fewer presses to better understand their true means.

1. **Average Rewards**:  
   - **Red**: 0.5 (highest average reward, based on 12 trials)  
   - **Yellow**: 0.5 (based on 2 trials)  
   - **Purple**: 0.5 (based on 2 trials)  
   - **Blue**: 0.3333 (based on 3 trials)  
   - **Green**: 0.0 (based on 2 trials)  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.5) and the most trials (12), making it a reliable choice for exploitation.  
   - The **yellow** and **purple buttons** also have a high average reward (0.5), but with fewer trials (2 each), they could still be worth exploring.  
   - The **blue button** has a lower average reward (0.3333) and has been tried 3 times, so it’s less promising.  
   - The **green button** has the lowest average reward (0.0) and has been tried twice, so it’s the least promising.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since the **red button** has the highest average reward and the most data, it’s the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
   - However, exploring **yellow** or **purple** could reveal if they have even higher rewards, but with only 100 time steps, exploitation is more critical.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - We’ve already explored the **Green button** twice with no reward, so further exploration here seems risky unless we suspect its mean is higher than observed.  
   - **Blue, Yellow, and Purple buttons** have limited data. Exploring them further could reveal higher rewards, but the risk is moderate since their current averages are lower than the **Red button**.  
   - The **Red button** is the safest choice for exploitation, given its high average reward and consistent performance.

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since the **Red button** has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it’s the best choice to maximize immediate reward.  
   - Exploring other buttons (especially **Blue, Yellow, or Purple**) could be beneficial, but with only 70 time steps remaining, the risk of lower rewards outweighs the potential gain.

   - **Yellow**: 3 presses, average reward 0.3333  
   - **Purple**: 3 presses, average reward 0.3333  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.45) and has been pressed the most (20 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice.  
   - The **blue**, **yellow**, and **purple buttons** have similar average rewards (0.3333) but have been pressed fewer times (3 each), so there’s potential for higher rewards if their true means are higher.  
   - The **green button** has an average reward of 0.0, which is the lowest, and has been pressed only twice, so it’s less explored but seems less promising based on current data.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since the **red button** has the highest average reward and has been sufficiently explored, it’s the safest choice to maximize immediate reward.  
   - However, to balance exploration and exploitation, we could consider pressing one of the less explored buttons (blue, yellow, or purple) to gather more data. Given their similar averages, any of these could be chosen.

4. **Strategy**: Given that we have 67 more time steps left, it's worth exploring the under-explored buttons to better understand their potential. However, since the red button has a significantly higher average reward and a more stable estimate, it remains a strong candidate.

5. **Decision**: To balance exploration and exploitation, we should prioritize buttons with fewer presses but also consider the red button's strong performance.

1. **Exploitation**: The **red button** has been pressed the most (24 times) and has the highest average reward (0.4166666666666667). This suggests it’s the best choice so far based on the data.

Their average rewards are either 0.3333333333333333 (blue, yellow, purple) or 0.0 (green). While the green button has shown no reward, the others have shown some potential. However, since we’ve only pressed them 3 times, we don’t have enough data to rule them out completely.

3. **Balancing Act**: Given that we’re only 36 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room to explore. However, the **red button** is clearly performing well, and pressing it again is likely to yield a good reward. At the same time, we should consider exploring the less-pressed buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option.

4. **Decision**: Since the **red button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, it’s the safest choice for exploitation. However, to ensure we’re not missing out on better options, we should also consider exploring one of the less-pressed buttons occasionally.

Given the current data, the **red button** remains the best choice for now, but we should keep in mind to explore other buttons in future steps.

1. **Current Best Performer**: The red button has the highest average reward of 0.4444444444444444, based on 27 presses. This suggests that the red button is the most reliable choice so far.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the red button is performing well, it's important to continue exploring other buttons to ensure we're not missing out on potentially better options. The blue, yellow, and purple buttons have been pressed only 3 times each, and the green button 4 times. These buttons have not been explored enough to rule them out completely.

3: **Prioritizing Exploration**: Given that we have 60 more time steps left, it's a good strategy to explore the less-pressed buttons to gather more data. However, since the red button is performing significantly better than the others, we should balance exploration with exploitation.

4. **Decision**: Considering the above points, I will choose to press the red button again to maximize the immediate reward while still keeping in mind the need to explore other buttons in the future.

   - **Green button** has an average reward of 0 (over 4 presses), making it the least promising option.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - We’ve already explored the green button enough, and its performance is poor.  
   - The red button is the best-performing option, but we should still explore the less-pressed buttons (blue, yellow, purple) to confirm their true means.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since the red button is the most reliable and has the highest average reward, it’s the best choice for exploitation.  
   - However, to balance exploration, we could occasionally try the blue, yellow, or purple buttons. But given only 100 time steps, prioritizing the red button is more optimal.

   - While the red button seems the best, the blue, yellow, and purple buttons have been under-explored. It’s worth testing them further to confirm their performance.  
   - The green button’s poor performance and higher number of trials make it less appealing for further exploration.

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Prioritize **red** for exploitation since it has the highest reward so far.  
   - Allocate some trials to **blue, yellow, or purple** to reduce uncertainty about their true performance.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.4333) and has been pressed the most (30 times). This suggests it’s a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: The **blue**, **yellow**, and **purple** buttons have been pressed only 3 times each, and all have the same average reward (0.3333). The **green button** has been pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.0, which is the lowest. Since the green button has already shown poor performance, it’s less likely to be a good choice.

3. **Balancing Act**: While the red button is the best-performing so far, we should still explore the other buttons (blue, yellow, purple) to confirm their true potential. However, since we’re only 43 time steps in, we have enough time to explore further.

4. **Decision**: Given the red button’s strong performance and the need to maximize rewards, it’s still the best choice for now. However, in the next few steps, we should prioritize exploring the under-pressed buttons (blue, yellow, purple) to gather more data.

1. **Current Best Performer**: The red button has the highest average reward (0.4054) and has been pressed the most (37 times), indicating a relatively stable estimate of its mean reward.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the red button seems the best so far, the other buttons (blue, yellow, purple) have been pressed only 3 times each, and green 4 times. This limited data means their true means could be higher than currently estimated.

3. **Potential for Higher Rewards**: The blue, yellow, and purple buttons all have the same average reward (0.3333), which is close to the red button's reward. Given the small sample size, it's worth exploring these buttons further to see if they might yield higher rewards.

4. **Green Button**: The green button has an average reward of 0.0, which is the lowest. However, with only 4 presses, it's possible that this is due to bad luck rather than a true low mean. Still, it's the least promising option based on current data.

**Decision**: Given the need to balance exploitation (choosing the best-known option) and exploration (testing less-known options), the best strategy is to continue exploring the buttons with limited data but promising potential. Among blue, yellow, and purple, any could be chosen, but since they have the same average reward, we can select one arbitrarily for exploration.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **red button** has been pressed the most (37 times) and has the highest average reward (0.4054). It seems like the best choice for exploitation.  
   - The **blue button** has a lower average reward (0.25) but has been pressed only 4 times, so it might still have potential.  
   - The **green button** has an average reward of 0.0, which is the lowest, so it’s less promising.  
   - The **yellow** and **purple buttons** have the same average reward (0.3333) and have been pressed only 3 times each, so they are worth exploring further.

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Since we have 49 time steps remaining, we should focus on both exploiting the best-known option (red) and exploring the less-pressed buttons (yellow and purple) to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially higher rewards.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the red button’s high average reward and the need to maximize total reward, it’s a strong candidate.  
   - However, exploring the yellow or purple buttons could reveal higher rewards, so we should allocate some trials to them.  

For this step, let’s **exploit the red button** since it has the highest known reward and has been pressed the most, making it a reliable choice.

1. **Current Best Performer**: The red button has been pressed 38 times with an average reward of 0.3947. This is the highest average reward among all buttons, making it the current best performer.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the red button seems to be the best choice based on current data, it's important to consider the other buttons that have been pressed fewer times. The blue, green, yellow, and purple buttons have been pressed only 3-4 times each, which means their average rewards might not be fully representative of their true potential.

3. **Potential for Higher Rewards**: The yellow and purple buttons both have an average reward of 0.3333, which is close to the red button's average. Given that they have been pressed only 3 times each, there's a possibility that further exploration might reveal them to be better options.

4. **Risk of Green Button**: The green button has an average reward of 0.0, which is the lowest. Given the limited data, it's possible that this button might perform better with more presses, but the risk seems higher compared to the others.

5. **Decision**: Given the current data, the red button is the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward. However, to balance exploration and exploitation, it might be beneficial to occasionally try the yellow or purple buttons, as they have shown potential and have been under-explored.

Considering the need to maximize total reward over the remaining time steps and the importance of both exploiting the best-known option and exploring under-explored options, the most balanced choice at this stage would be to continue with the red button while keeping an eye on the potential of yellow and purple.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **red button** has been pressed the most (39 times) and has the highest average reward (0.41025641025641024). This suggests it is a good candidate for exploitation.  
   - The **blue, green, yellow, and purple buttons** have been pressed fewer times (3-4 times each), which means we have less information about their true reward distributions. These buttons are candidates for exploration.

2. **Current Rewards**:  
   - **Red button**: Highest average reward (0.41025641025641024).  
   - **Yellow and purple buttons**: Both have an average reward of 0.3333333333333333, which is lower than the red button but still decent.  
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of 0.25, which is lower than the red, yellow, and purple buttons.  
   - **Green button**: Average reward of 0.0, which is the lowest.

3. **Exploration Strategy**:  
   - Since the **yellow and purple buttons** have been pressed only 3 times each, they are good candidates for exploration to see if they might yield higher rewards than the red button.  
   - The **green button** has shown no reward so far, so it is less attractive for exploration unless we suspect its true reward is higher than observed.

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the limited remaining time steps (47 out of 100), we should prioritize buttons with higher observed rewards while still exploring those with fewer presses.  
   - The **red button** is the safest choice for exploitation, but exploring the **yellow or purple buttons** could potentially yield higher rewards if their true means are higher than the red button.

**Final Choice**:  
To balance exploitation and exploration, I will choose the **red button** for now, as it has the highest observed reward and is a safer choice. However, in subsequent steps, I will consider exploring the **yellow or purple buttons** further.

3. **Risk of Sticking with Red**: Continuing to press the red button maximizes the expected reward based on current data, but it doesn't explore the potential of other buttons. If one of the less-pressed buttons has a higher mean, we might miss out on higher rewards.

4. **Exploring Other Buttons**: Pressing one of the less-explored buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple) could provide more information about their true mean rewards. Since they all have the same number of presses and average reward, any of them could be chosen for exploration.

5. **Decision**: Given that we have only 42 time steps left (100 - 58 = 42), and the red button has shown the best performance so far, it's reasonable to continue exploiting the red button to maximize the total reward.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the red button seems to be the best choice based on current data, it's important to consider whether we should explore other buttons to gather more information. However, given that we only have 41 time steps left (100 - 59 = 41), and the red button has already been pressed 43 times, it's likely that further exploration might not yield significantly better results.

3. **Under-explored Buttons**: The blue, green, yellow, and purple buttons have each been pressed only 4 times. Their average rewards are 0.25, 0.0, 0.25, and 0.25, respectively. The green button has the lowest average reward, but with only 4 presses, it's possible that it might perform better with more trials. However, given the limited time left, focusing on the red button seems more prudent.

4. **Decision**: Given the high average reward of the red button and the limited time left for exploration, the best strategy is to continue exploiting the red button to maximize the total reward.

   - **Yellow**: 4 presses, average reward 0.25
   - **Purple**: 4 presses, average reward 0.25

2. **Observation**:
   - The **red button** has been pressed the most (44 times) and has the highest average reward (0.38636363636363635).
   - The **green button** has the lowest average reward (0.0), indicating it might not be a good choice.
   - The **blue**, **yellow**, and **purple buttons** have similar average rewards (0.25) but have been pressed fewer times compared to the red button.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Since the **red button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, it seems to be the most reliable choice so far.
   - However, the **blue**, **yellow**, and **purple buttons** have been explored less, and their true potential might not be fully known yet. Given that we still have 40 time steps left, it might be beneficial to explore these buttons a bit more to ensure we are not missing out on a potentially better option.

4. **Decision**:
   - Given the current data, the **red button** is the safest choice to maximize immediate reward.
   - However, to balance exploration and exploitation, we could consider pressing one of the less explored buttons (blue, yellow, or purple) in the next few steps.

For this step, since the **red button** has consistently provided the highest reward, it is the most logical choice to maximize the total reward.

1. **Current Best Option**: The red button has the highest average reward (0.423) based on 52 trials, which is a substantial number of observations. This suggests that the red button is likely the best option so far.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the red button seems promising, the other buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple) have only been pressed 4 times each.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the red button seems the best so far, we should also consider exploring other buttons to gather more information, especially those with fewer presses. The blue button, despite having a slightly lower average reward, has been pressed only 5 times, which means its true mean could be higher or lower than what we've observed.

3. **Under-Explored Buttons**: The green, yellow, and purple buttons have all been pressed only 4 times each. Their average rewards are 0.0, 0.25, and 0.25, respectively. Given the limited data, it's hard to conclude their true performance. Exploring these buttons could reveal a better option.

4. **Strategy**: Given that we have only 31 time steps left (100 - 69 = 31), we should balance exploitation (choosing the best-known option) with exploration (trying under-explored options). Since the red button is performing well and has been tested extensively, it's a safe choice. However, to maximize potential gains, we should also explore buttons with fewer presses, especially those with non-zero rewards.

**Decision**: The blue button, despite having a slightly lower average reward than the red button, has been pressed only 5 times, which is significantly fewer than the red button's 52 presses. This suggests that the blue button's true mean could be higher than what we've observed. Given the limited remaining time steps, exploring the blue button further could be beneficial.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation Analysis**:
   - **Blue button**: Highest average reward (0.5714) but only pressed 7 times. It seems promising but needs more exploration to confirm its true mean.
   - **Red button**: Pressed 52 times with an average reward of 0.4231. This is a reliable choice but not the highest average.
   - **Green, Yellow, Purple buttons**: All pressed 4 times with low average rewards (0.0, 0.25, 0.25). These seem less promising but could still be worth exploring further.

2. **Exploration Analysis**:
   - **Blue button**: Despite its high average, it has been pressed only 7 times. More exploration is needed to confirm its potential.
   - **Green, Yellow, Purple buttons**: These have been pressed the least (4 times each) and could still have higher true means than observed so far.

3. **Decision**:
   - The **blue button** has the highest observed average reward but needs more exploration to confirm its true mean. Given its potential, it’s worth pressing again.
   - The **green, yellow, and purple buttons** have been under-explored and could still yield higher rewards, but their current averages are low.

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, the **blue button** is the best choice at this stage due to its high observed reward and the need for further confirmation.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.5714) but has only been pressed 14 times. It seems promising but could benefit from further exploration.  
   - The **red button** has been pressed the most (52 times) with an average reward of 0.4231, which is lower than the blue button’s average.  
   - The **green, yellow, and purple buttons** have been pressed only 4 times each, with low average rewards (0.0, 0.25, 0.25 respectively). They could still have higher true means but need more exploration.

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 22 time steps left (100 - 78 = 22), we should focus on exploiting the button with the highest known reward while still exploring the less-pressed buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed relatively fewer times compared to the red button. It’s a good candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, the **green button** has an average reward of 0.0, which seems unusually low. Given that it has only been pressed 4 times, it’s worth exploring further to confirm if its true mean is indeed that low or if it was just bad luck.  

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, and considering the limited time steps left, the best choice is to **exploit the blue button** while keeping an eye on the green button for potential exploration in the next few steps.

   - Green: 0.0 (no reward)  
   - Yellow: 0.25 (low reward, similar to purple)  
   - Purple: 0.25 (low reward, similar to yellow)  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The blue button has the highest average reward but has been pressed only 15 times, which is relatively fewer compared to the red button (52 times).  
   - The green, yellow, and purple buttons have been pressed only 4 times each, so their average rewards might not be fully representative due to limited data.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since the blue button has the highest average reward and has been explored less compared to the red button, it is a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, the green, yellow, and purple buttons could still have higher rewards, but their current averages are low and not promising.  

Given the data, the **blue button** is the best choice to maximize the total reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.456) and has been pressed the most (57 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice for exploitation.  
   - The **blue button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.421) but has been pressed 19 times, making it a decent alternative.  
   - The **green**, **yellow**, and **purple buttons** have been pressed only 4 times each, and their average rewards are lower (0.0 for green, 0.25 for yellow and purple). However, they still have potential and could be worth exploring.

2. **Current State**:  
   - We have 12 time steps remaining (100 - 88 = 12).  
   - Given the limited time, focusing on exploitation is more critical, but we should still explore underperforming buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option.

3. **Decision**:  
   - The **red button** is the best choice for exploitation, given its high average reward and reliability.  
   - However, the **green button** has been pressed only 4 times and has an average reward of 0.0, which seems unusually low. It’s worth exploring once more to confirm its performance.  

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, and the limited time remaining, the **red button** is the safest and most rewarding choice at this stage.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.4655) and has been pressed the most (58 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice.  
   - The **blue button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.4211) but has been pressed 19 times, which is a decent sample size.  
   - The **green**, **yellow**, and **purple buttons** have been pressed only 4 times each, with average rewards of 0.0, 0.25, and 0.25, respectively. These buttons have not been explored enough, and their true potential is still uncertain.

2. **Current State**:  
   - We have 11 time steps remaining (100 - 89 = 11).  
   - The **red button** is the most promising based on current data, but we should also consider exploring the under-explored buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option.

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the limited time left (11 steps), it’s risky to explore buttons with low or zero rewards (like green) without strong evidence of their potential.  
   - The **yellow** and **purple buttons** have shown some potential with an average reward of 0.25, but they are still under-explored.  
   - The **red button** remains the safest choice for exploitation, but we should allocate a few steps to explore **yellow** and **purple** to confirm their potential.

   - Given the limited time, the **red button** is the safest and most rewarding choice based on the data we have. Its higher average reward and larger sample size make it the optimal choice for maximizing the total reward in the remaining steps.

Each button is associated with a Bernoulli distribution with a fixed but unknown mean; the means for the buttons could be different. For each button, when you press it, you will get a reward that is sampled from the button's associated distribution. You have 100 time steps and, on each time step, you can choose any button and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to consider both the average rewards of the buttons we've already pressed and the potential for higher rewards from buttons we haven't pressed as much. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the average rewards**:  
   - **Red button**: 0.4545 (highest average reward, pressed 66 times)  
   - **Blue button**: 0.4211 (second-highest average reward, pressed 19 times)  
   - **Purple button**: 0.25 (pressed 4 times)  
   - **Yellow button**: 0.2 (pressed 5 times)  
   - **Green button**: 0.0 (pressed 4 times)  

2. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, making it a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - The **blue button** has a slightly lower average reward but has been pressed fewer times than the red button, so it could still be a good choice.  
   - The **purple**, **yellow**, and **green** buttons have been pressed very few times, and their average rewards are lower, but there’s a chance they could yield higher rewards if explored further.  

3. **Decision for the next step**:  
   - Since we only have **2 time steps left**, the focus should be on **exploitation** rather than exploration.  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward and is the most reliable choice to maximize the total reward in the remaining steps.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to choose the button that has the highest expected reward based on the information we have so far. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the average rewards for each button:**
   - **Blue button:** Average reward = 0.421 (from 19 presses)
   - **Green button:** Average reward = 0.0 (from 4 presses)
   - **Red button:** Average reward = 0.448 (from 67 presses)
   - **Yellow button:** Average reward = 0.2 (from 5 presses)
   - **Purple button:** Average reward = 0.25 (from 4 presses)

2. **Identify the button with the highest average reward:**
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward of 0.448.

3. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation:**
   - Since this is the 100th and final time step, the focus should be on **exploitation** to maximize the immediate reward rather than exploring less-pressed buttons.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The **red button** has consistently provided the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, indicating a reliable choice for maximizing the reward in the final step.
