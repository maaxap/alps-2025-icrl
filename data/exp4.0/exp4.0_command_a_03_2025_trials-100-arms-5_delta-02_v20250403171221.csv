2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** At this early stage, exploration is more valuable than exploitation because we lack data on most buttons.

1. **Current Observations**:

   - **Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple buttons**: Each pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0. These buttons have not yet shown any positive reward, but their true means are still unknown.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed more than once, giving us some confidence in its performance.  
   - The other buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple) have only been pressed once, so their true potential is still uncertain.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since the **red button** has shown the best performance so far, it makes sense to exploit it further to maximize immediate rewards.  
   - However, we should also consider exploring the other buttons occasionally to gather more information about their potential rewards.  

4. **Decision**:

   - However, the **red button** is clearly the best-performing button so far, and pressing it again is likely to yield a high reward.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high reward of the **red button** and the need to maximize immediate rewards while still leaving room for exploration later, pressing the **red button** again is the best choice at this stage.

1. **Red Button**: Pressed 7 times with an average reward of 0.7142857142857143. This is the highest average reward among all buttons, and it has been pressed the most, giving us more confidence in its estimated mean.

2. **Blue Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. While this is a decent reward, it has been pressed fewer times compared to the red button, so our confidence in its estimated mean is lower.

3. **Green, Yellow, and Purple Buttons**: Each has been pressed only once, and all have an average reward of 0.0. This means we have very little information about these buttons, and their true means could be higher or lower.

**Strategy**:  
- **Exploitation**: Choose the button with the highest known average reward (red) to maximize immediate reward.  
- **Exploration**: Consider trying under-explored buttons (green, yellow, purple) to gather more information, but this is riskier given the limited time steps.  

Given that we have only 100 time steps and want to maximize total reward, **exploitation** is the better strategy at this point, especially since the red button has a high average reward and has been tested more than the others.

2. **Blue Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. While this is a decent reward, it has been pressed fewer times compared to the red button, so the estimate might be less reliable.

- **Exploration**: Test the buttons with limited data to gather more information and potentially discover a better option.

Given that we have 100 time steps and have only used 13 so far, we still have plenty of time to explore. However, the red button has shown the most promise with a high average reward and a reasonable number of trials. 

To balance exploitation and exploration, we should continue to favor the red button while occasionally testing the less explored buttons. Since the red button has the highest average reward and a stable estimate, it is the best choice for now.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **red button** has been pressed 14 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is the most frequently pressed button and has a consistent reward, making it a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - The **blue button** has been pressed only 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. While it has the same average reward as the red button, it has been pressed much less, so there’s potential for it to be better or worse.  
   - The **green**, **yellow**, and **purple buttons** have each been pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not been explored enough, and their true potential is unknown.  

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Since we have 81 time steps remaining, we should allocate some of these steps to explore the less-pressed buttons to gather more data.  
   - However, we should also continue exploiting the red button, as it has proven to be reliable so far.  

3. **Next Choice**:  
   - Given that the **green**, **yellow**, and **purple buttons** have been pressed only once, it’s a good idea to explore one of them next to reduce uncertainty.  
   - Among these, any choice is equally valid since they all have the same average reward (0.0) and have been pressed the same number of times.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The red button has the highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed the most (14 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
2. **Exploration**: The yellow and purple buttons have been pressed only once each and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to chance, and they might have higher true means. The blue and green buttons have been pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.3333, which is lower than the red button but still worth considering.  
3. **Strategy**: Since we have 78 time steps remaining, we should continue exploring the less-pressed buttons (yellow and purple) to gather more information about their true means. However, given the limited data, the red button remains the safest choice for exploitation.  

Given the current data, the **red button** is the best choice for maximizing immediate reward while we continue to explore other buttons in future steps.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance exploration (trying buttons with fewer presses to learn their true reward potential) and exploitation (pressing buttons that have shown higher rewards so far).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Observations**:
   - **Red button**: Highest average reward (0.5) with 20 presses.
   - **Blue and Green buttons**: Both have an average reward of 0.3333 with 3 presses each.
   - **Yellow and Purple buttons**: Both have an average reward of 0.0, but with very few presses (3 and 2, respectively).

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - **Red button** is the safest choice for exploitation since it has the highest average reward so far.
   - **Yellow and Purple buttons** have not shown any reward yet, but they have been pressed very few times. There’s a chance they might have higher rewards, so exploring them could be beneficial.
   - **Blue and Green buttons** are in between—they have shown some reward but have been pressed fewer times than the red button.

3. **Decision**:
   - Since the **red button** has consistently shown the highest reward and has been pressed the most, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - However, **yellow and purple buttons** have been pressed very few times, and their true potential is still unknown. Exploring them could lead to discovering a higher reward.

4. **Balancing Act**:
   - Given that we have 69 more time steps left, it’s worth exploring the **yellow and purple buttons** further to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially higher rewards.
   - However, since the **red button** has proven to be reliable, it’s also a safe choice.

5. **Final Choice**:
   - To balance exploration and exploitation, let’s explore the **purple button** next, as it has been pressed the least and has shown no reward yet. This gives us more information about its potential.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Observations**:
   - **Red button**: Pressed 21 times with an average reward of 0.476. This is the highest average reward so far, indicating it might be the best button.
   - **Blue and Green buttons**: Both pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.333. These buttons have potential but need more exploration.
   - **Yellow and Purple buttons**: Both pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not yielded any reward yet, but they could still have higher means (we don’t know yet).

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - **Exploitation**: The red button has the highest average reward, so pressing it again is likely to yield a good reward.
   - **Exploration**: The blue, green, yellow, and purple buttons have been pressed fewer times. Exploring them could reveal higher rewards, especially since their averages are based on only 3 presses.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given that we have 100 time steps and have only used 33 so far, we still have room for exploration. However, the red button has shown consistent higher rewards, making it a safer choice for exploitation.
   - To balance exploration and exploitation, we should prioritize buttons with fewer presses but also consider the red button’s strong performance.

4. **Final Choice**:
   - Since the red button has the highest average reward and has been pressed significantly more than the others, it remains the best choice for now. However, we should keep exploring other buttons in subsequent steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Observations**:
   - **Red button**: Pressed 29 times with an average reward of 0.5172. This is the highest average reward so far, indicating it’s the best-performing button currently.
   - **Blue and Green buttons**: Both pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.3333. These buttons have potential but need more exploration.
   - **Yellow and Purple buttons**: Both pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not yielded any rewards yet, but they could still have higher means (we don’t know yet).

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - **Exploitation**: The red button has the highest average reward, so pressing it again is likely to yield a good reward.
   - **Exploration**: The blue, green, yellow, and purple buttons have been pressed only 3 times each. Given that we have 59 time steps left, it’s worth exploring these buttons further to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option.

3. **Decision**:
   - Since the red button has been pressed significantly more than the others and has a high average reward, it’s a safe choice for exploitation.
   - However, to ensure we’re not overlooking a better option, we should also explore the less-pressed buttons. Given that yellow and purple have shown no rewards yet, they are riskier but could have higher potential.

4. **Final Choice**:
   - Given the current data, the **red button** remains the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward. However, to balance exploration, we could consider pressing one of the less-explored buttons (e.g., blue or green) in the next few steps.

For this step, since the red button has the highest average reward and we’re still early in the exploration phase, we’ll exploit it for now.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The red button has the highest average reward (0.5) based on the most data (30 presses). This suggests it’s the best choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: The blue and green buttons have the same average reward (0.3333) but with fewer presses (3 each). They might have higher true means than currently observed, so exploring them further could be beneficial.

3. **Avoidance**: The yellow and purple buttons have an average reward of 0.0 with 3 presses each. Given the limited data and poor performance, they are less promising.

4. **Strategy**: Since we have only 58 time steps left (100 - 42), we should prioritize exploiting the best-known option while still exploring the blue and green buttons to confirm their potential.

4. **Decision**: To maximize the total reward, we should prioritize the button with the highest observed reward (red) while occasionally exploring other buttons.

2. **Exploration**: The other buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple) have been pressed fewer times, and their average rewards are either lower or not significantly different from the red button. However, we should still explore them to ensure we’re not missing a better option.

3. **Prioritizing Exploration**: The purple button has the lowest average reward (0.0) but has only been pressed 3 times. It’s possible that its true mean is higher than observed so far, and further exploration could reveal this.

4. **Balancing Act**: Given that we have 50 time steps left, we should prioritize exploring the least-pressed buttons while still exploiting the red button, which has proven to be reliable.

**Decision**: Let’s explore the purple button next, as it has the lowest average reward but has been under-explored. This could potentially uncover a higher reward than expected.

1. **Current Observations**:
   - **Red button**: Pressed 37 times with an average reward of 0.4054. This is the highest average reward so far and has been pressed the most, indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Blue and Green buttons**: Both pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.3333. These buttons have fewer presses, so their true reward means are less certain. They could be worth exploring further.
   - **Yellow and Purple buttons**: Both pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.25. These buttons have lower average rewards and fewer presses, making them less attractive for exploitation but still worth considering for exploration.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - We’ve already pressed the red button 37 times, which is a significant portion of the total presses. While it has the highest average reward, continuing to press it exclusively might not be optimal if other buttons have higher true rewards that we haven’t discovered yet.
   - The blue and green buttons have been pressed only 3 times each, which is not enough to confidently estimate their true reward means. Exploring these buttons further could be beneficial.
   - The yellow and purple buttons have slightly more presses (4 each) but lower average rewards. They are less promising but still worth considering for exploration.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given that the red button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, it’s a safe choice for exploitation.
   - However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing buttons with fewer presses to gather more data. The blue and green buttons are good candidates for this.

**Final Decision**:  
Since the red button has the highest average reward and we’ve already explored the other buttons to some extent, we’ll continue to exploit the red button for now while keeping in mind to explore other buttons in future steps.

1. **Current Averages**:  
   - **Blue**: 0.25 (4 trials)  
   - **Green**: 0.5 (4 trials)  
   - **Red**: 0.3636 (44 trials)  
   - **Yellow**: 0.25 (4 trials)  
   - **Purple**: 0.25 (4 trials)  

2. **Key Observations**:  
   - **Green** has the highest average reward (0.5), but it has only been pressed 4 times, so its true mean is still uncertain.  
   - **Red** has a moderate average reward (0.3636) and has been pressed 44 times, making its estimate more reliable.  
   - **Blue**, **Yellow**, and **Purple** all have the same low average reward (0.25) and have been pressed equally (4 times each).  

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - Since we have 40 time steps left, we should balance exploration (trying under-explored buttons) and exploitation (choosing the best-known option).  
   - **Green** is the most promising for exploration due to its high average reward, despite limited trials.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - **Green** is the best choice because it has the highest average reward and needs more trials to confirm its true mean.

   - Green has been pressed 5 times, slightly more than the others but still limited.  
   - Red has been pressed 44 times, providing a more reliable estimate of its mean.  

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The green button has the highest average reward so far (0.4), but it has been pressed only 5 times. It’s worth exploring further to confirm its potential.  
   - The red button has a lower average reward (0.3636) but has been pressed 44 times, making its estimate more reliable.  
   - Blue, Yellow, and Purple have low average rewards and limited data, so they are less promising unless we want to explore further.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the limited data for green and its higher average reward, it’s a good candidate for exploration to confirm its potential.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The red button has the highest average reward (0.3636) and has been pressed the most (44 times). This suggests it might be the best option based on current data.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the red button seems promising, the other buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple) have been pressed only 4-6 times, which is not enough to confidently conclude their true reward distributions. The green button has a slightly higher average reward (0.3333) than blue, yellow, and purple (all 0.25), but it has only been pressed 6 times.

3. **Prioritizing Exploration**: Given that we still have 38 time steps left (100 - 62), it’s worth exploring the buttons that have been pressed fewer times to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option. The green button is the next best candidate after red, and it has been pressed the least among the higher-performing buttons.

3. **Trade-off**: While the red button is the best choice based on current data, we still have 37 time steps left. It’s worth exploring the less-pressed buttons (blue, yellow, purple) to see if they might yield higher rewards. However, since their average rewards are lower and they’ve been pressed equally, we should prioritize the one with the highest potential upside.

1. **Current Best Performer**: The red button has the highest average reward (0.38) and has been pressed the most (50 times). This suggests it is a reliable choice for exploitation.

2. **Exploration Opportunity**: The blue, yellow, and purple buttons have been pressed only 4 times each, and the green button has been pressed 7 times. These buttons have lower average rewards but could potentially have higher true means that we haven’t discovered yet due to insufficient sampling.

3. **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation**: Since we have 31 time steps remaining (100 - 69 = 31), we should allocate some of these steps to explore the less-pressed buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option.

4. **Prioritizing Exploration**: Among the less-pressed buttons, the green button has the highest average reward (0.2857) compared to blue, yellow, and purple (all at 0.25). It’s a good candidate for exploration as it has shown slightly better performance than the others with limited data.

**Decision**: Given the remaining time steps, it’s a good strategy to explore the green button further to confirm its potential.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The red button has consistently performed well, so exploiting it further seems like a good strategy.  
   - However, the other buttons have been pressed very few times, and their true reward distributions might not be fully understood yet.  

3. **Remaining Time Steps**:  
   - There are 30 time steps left (100 total - 70 used).  
   - Given the limited time, focusing on the button with the highest known reward (red) is likely the best strategy to maximize total reward.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - While exploring other buttons might reveal higher rewards, the risk of lower rewards outweighs the potential benefit given the remaining time.

### Analysis:
1. **Red Button**:  
   - Pressed 51 times with an average reward of **0.3725**.  
   - This is the highest average reward observed so far, making it the most promising choice for exploitation.

2. **Other Buttons (Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple)**:  
   - Each pressed 4 times with an average reward of **0.25**.  
   - These buttons have been explored minimally, and their true potential is still uncertain.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The red button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, so it is a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.  
- **Exploration**: However, with only 29 time steps remaining (100 - 71 = 29), we should also consider exploring the other buttons to ensure we are not missing a potentially better option.  

Given the limited time and the significant lead of the red button, it is reasonable to continue exploiting the red button while occasionally exploring the others.  

### Decision:
Since the red button has the highest average reward and has been explored sufficiently, it is the best choice for this time step.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the red button seems promising, the other buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple) have been pressed only 4 times each, and their average rewards are all 0.25.

3. **Remaining Time Steps**: With 26 time steps left (100 - 74 = 26), we need to balance between exploiting the current best option (red button) and exploring the other buttons to ensure we're not missing out on a potentially better option.

4. **Strategy**: Given the limited time left, it's risky to explore buttons that have shown lower average rewards so far. However, pressing the red button every time might not be optimal if one of the under-explored buttons has a higher true mean. A balanced approach would be to continue exploiting the red button while occasionally exploring the others, especially those with fewer presses.

### Analysis:
1. **Red Button**:

   - This is the highest average reward observed so far, making it the most promising choice for exploitation.

2. **Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple Buttons**:

   - These buttons are underexplored, and their true reward potential is still uncertain.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
  With only 16 time steps remaining (100 - 84 = 16), we should focus on exploiting the button with the highest known reward (red) while still allocating a few trials to explore the underexplored buttons.  

- **Allocation**:  
  - Dedicate 12 of the remaining 16 trials to the red button (exploitation).  
  - Use the remaining 4 trials to explore one of the underexplored buttons (blue, green, yellow, or purple).  

### Choice for Next Step:

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Data Analysis**:
   - **Red button**: Pressed 67 times with an average reward of 0.3134. This is the most frequently pressed button and has the highest average reward so far.
   - **Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple buttons**: Each pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.25. These buttons have been explored very little, so their true reward rates are still uncertain.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - With only 13 time steps remaining (100 - 87 = 13), we need to focus more on exploitation since there’s limited time to explore.
   - However, the red button has been pressed significantly more than the others, and its average reward is only slightly higher than the others (0.3134 vs. 0.25). Given the small difference, it’s worth considering if one of the less-pressed buttons might have a higher true reward rate.

3. **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Strategy**:
   - To balance exploration and exploitation, we can use a UCB-like approach. The UCB for a button is calculated as:  
     \[
     \text{UCB} = \text{Average Reward} + \sqrt{\frac{\ln(n)}{k}},
     \]  
     where \( n \) is the total number of presses so far (87), and \( k \) is the number of times the button has been pressed.
   - For the red button:  
     \[
     \text{UCB}_{\text{red}} = 0.3134 + \sqrt{\frac{\ln(87)}{67}} \approx 0.3134 + 0.147 \approx 0.4604.
     \]
   - For the blue, green, yellow, and purple buttons:  
     \[
     \text{UCB}_{\text{other}} = 0.25 + \sqrt{\frac{\ln(87)}{4}} \approx 0.25 + 0.58 \approx 0.83.
     \]

4. **Decision**:
   - The UCB for the less-pressed buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple) is significantly higher than the UCB for the red button. This suggests that exploring one of these buttons could yield a higher reward.
   - Since all four (blue, green, yellow, purple) have the same average reward and UCB, we can choose any one of them.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Current Best Option**: The red button has the highest average reward (0.3134) based on 67 presses. This suggests it is the most promising button so far.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: With only 12 time steps remaining (100 - 88 = 12), we need to focus more on exploitation rather than exploration. However, it’s still worth considering whether any of the less-pressed buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple) might have higher true means that we haven’t discovered yet.

3. **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**: A common strategy in bandit problems is to use the UCB algorithm, which balances exploration and exploitation. The UCB for each button can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{UCB}(a) = \bar{x}_a + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln n}{n_a}}
   \]
   where:
   - \(\bar{x}_a\) is the average reward of button \(a\),
   - \(n_a\) is the number of times button \(a\) has been pressed,
   - \(n\) is the total number of presses so far (88 in this case).

4. **Calculating UCBs**:
   - **Red**: \(\bar{x}_{\text{red}} = 0.3134\), \(n_{\text{red}} = 67\)
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{red}) = 0.3134 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 88}{67}} \approx 0.3134 + 0.147 \approx 0.4604
     \]
   - **Blue**: \(\bar{x}_{\text{blue}} = 0.2\), \(n_{\text{blue}} = 5\)
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{blue}) = 0.2 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 88}{5}} \approx 0.2 + 0.744 \approx 0.944
     \]
   - **Green**: \(\bar{x}_{\text{green}} = 0.25\), \(n_{\text{green}} = 8\)
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{green}) = 0.25 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 88}{8}} \approx 0.25 + 0.577 \approx 0.827
     \]
   - **Yellow**: \(\bar{x}_{\text{yellow}} = 0.25\), \(n_{\text{yellow}} = 4\)
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{yellow}) = 0.25 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 88}{4}} \approx 0.25 + 0.833 \approx 1.083
     \]
   - **Purple**: \(\bar{x}_{\text{purple}} = 0.25\), \(n_{\text{purple}} = 4\)
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{purple}) = 0.25 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 88}{4}} \approx 0.25 + 0.833 \approx 1.083
     \]

5. **Decision**: The yellow and purple buttons have the highest UCBs, indicating they might be worth exploring further. However, given the limited time steps remaining (12), and the fact that the red button has a significantly higher average reward and a reasonably high UCB, it’s still the best choice to maximize immediate rewards.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between exploiting the button with the highest known average reward and exploring other buttons to gather more information about their potential rewards. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **red button** has been pressed 68 times with an average reward of 0.3088, which is the highest among all buttons. This suggests that the red button is the most promising choice for exploitation.  
   - The other buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple) have been pressed fewer times and have lower or similar average rewards. However, their true means are still uncertain due to limited data.  

2. **Remaining Time Steps**:  
   - We have **11 time steps** left (100 - 89 = 11). Given the limited time, focusing on the button with the highest known reward (red) is a safer strategy to maximize total reward.  

3. **Exploration Consideration**:  
   - While exploring other buttons could reveal higher rewards, the risk of wasting time steps on lower-reward buttons is high, especially with only 11 steps left.  
   - The green, yellow, and purple buttons have similar average rewards (0.25) and have been pressed only 4-8 times, but their potential upside is not significant enough to justify exploration over exploitation of the red button.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - The **red button** is the best choice for the next time step, as it has the highest known average reward and is the most likely to yield the highest total reward in the remaining time steps.

1. **Current Best Option (Exploitation):**  
   The red button has the highest average reward (0.3188) based on 69 presses. This suggests it is the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration Consideration:**  
   The blue, green, yellow, and purple buttons have been pressed fewer times (5, 8, 4, and 4 times, respectively). Their average rewards are lower than the red button, but they have not been explored enough to rule them out completely. However, with only 10 time steps remaining, the potential gain from exploring these buttons is limited.

3. **Risk vs. Reward:**  
   Exploring other buttons could yield a higher reward if one of them has a higher mean than the red button, but the probability of this is low given the current data. The red button is the safer and more likely choice to maximize total reward in the remaining steps.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   Given the limited time steps left and the red button's consistently higher average reward, it is the best choice to maximize the total reward.

2. **Green, Yellow, and Purple Buttons**: These buttons have been pressed 8, 4, and 4 times, respectively, all with an average reward of 0.25.
