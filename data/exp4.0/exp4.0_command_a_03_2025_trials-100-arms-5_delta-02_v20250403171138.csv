A common strategy in such scenarios is to use an **exploration-exploitation** approach, where we initially explore all options to gather information before exploiting the best-performing option.

Given that all buttons have been pressed 0 times, we can start by arbitrarily choosing any button. To ensure fairness and systematic exploration, we can select the buttons in a predefined order, such as alphabetically.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. No data is available for any button, so all buttons are equally unknown.
2. Start with the first button in alphabetical order to systematically explore.
3. The first button alphabetically is **blue**.

1. **Current Observations**:

   - **Blue**, **Green**, and **Red** have each been pressed once with an average reward of 0.0.

- **Exploitation**: Based on the current data, the blue button has the highest average reward, so choosing it again would be a safe bet to maximize immediate reward.
- **Exploration**: However, we also need to explore other buttons to gather more data and potentially find a better option. The green, red, and purple buttons have been pressed fewer times, so there's a chance they might yield higher rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button**: Highest average reward (0.6666) with 3 presses. It seems promising but needs more validation.  
   - **Green button**: Average reward (0.5) with only 2 presses. It could be better or worse with more presses.  
   - **Red button**: Average reward (0.0) with 2 presses. It seems unpromising but could improve with more exploration.  
   - **Yellow button**: Average reward (0.3333) with 3 presses. It’s not as good as blue but still worth considering.  
   - **Purple button**: Average reward (0.0) with only 1 press. It’s the least explored and could have a higher reward.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   - The **purple button** has been pressed only once, and its average reward is based on a single sample. It’s worth exploring further to determine if it’s better than its current average.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - While the **blue button** is the most promising so far, the **purple button** is the least explored and could potentially yield higher rewards. Given the early stage (only 11 presses out of 100), exploration is still valuable.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is the highest average reward so far, but it has been pressed the least among the buttons with positive rewards, so there's still some uncertainty about its true mean.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.0. This button has not yielded any rewards, so it seems like a poor choice based on current data.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.3333. This is a lower average compared to blue and green, and it has been pressed more than green, so it's less promising than green but still better than red.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. Similar to the green button, it has a high average reward but with limited data.

**Strategy**: 
- The green and purple buttons both have the highest average rewards (0.5), but they have been pressed fewer times compared to the blue button. This suggests that there might be more potential in these buttons, as their true means could be higher than what we've observed so far.
- Given the limited data for both green and purple, and since they have the same average reward, we can choose one of them to explore further.

1. **Current Average Rewards**:
   - Blue: 0.333 (6 presses)
   - Green: 0.25 (4 presses)
   - Red: 0.25 (4 presses)

2. **Exploitation**:
   - The **yellow button** has the highest average reward (0.5) so far, making it the best choice for exploitation.

3. **Exploration**:
   - The **purple button** has been pressed the least (3 times) and has a decent average reward (0.333). Exploring it further could reveal if it’s better than the yellow button.

4. **Decision**:
   - Since the yellow button has the highest average reward and has been pressed only 4 times, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation. However, we should also consider exploring the purple button, which has fewer presses and a similar average reward to the blue button.

5. **Final Choice**:
   - Given the high reward of the yellow button and the need to confirm its performance, we’ll choose it for now.

   - **Green, Red, Purple buttons**: All have the same low average reward (0.25) with only 4 presses each. These buttons need more exploration to determine their true potential.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - **Exploitation**: The yellow button has consistently given the highest rewards, so pressing it again is a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.
   - **Exploration**: The green, red, and purple buttons have been pressed only 4 times each, which is not enough to confidently conclude their true reward potential. Exploring these buttons could reveal a better option than yellow.

3. **Decision**:
   - Since we’re only 30 time steps in (out of 100), there’s still ample time to explore. However, the yellow button’s strong performance makes it a compelling choice. To balance exploration and exploitation, we’ll prioritize the yellow button for now but keep in mind to explore the less-pressed buttons in future steps.

1. **Evaluate the average rewards**:  
   - **Yellow button**: 0.6154 (highest average reward)  
   - **Blue button**: 0.3333  
   - **Green button**: 0.25  
   - **Red button**: 0.25  
   - **Purple button**: 0.25  

2. **Consider the number of trials**:  
   - Yellow has been pressed 13 times, which is more than the others, but its average reward is significantly higher.  
   - Blue has been pressed 6 times, and its average reward is moderate.  
   - Green, Red, and Purple have been pressed only 4 times each, so their true means might not be fully explored yet.  

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The yellow button has the highest average reward and has been tested more than the others, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, since we still have many time steps left (69 out of 100), we should also consider exploring the less-tested buttons (Green, Red, Purple) to ensure we don’t miss a potentially better option.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Given the current data, the **yellow button** is the best choice for exploitation, as it has the highest average reward and has been tested sufficiently. Exploring other buttons can be done in subsequent steps if needed.

   - **Yellow button**: Highest average reward (0.642857) over 14 presses.
   - **Blue button**: Second-highest average reward (0.333333) over 6 presses.
   - **Green, Red, Purple buttons**: All have the same average reward (0.25) over 4 presses each.

   - **Exploration**: The green, red, and purple buttons have been pressed fewer times and have the same average reward. There’s a chance one of them might have a higher mean reward that we haven’t discovered yet.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Given that we have 68 time steps remaining (100 - 32), we can afford to explore a bit more while still exploiting the best-known option.

1. **Current Best Option**: The yellow button has the highest average reward (0.6) based on 15 presses. This suggests it might be the best button to press.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the yellow button seems promising, we have pressed it 15 times, which is significantly more than the other buttons. The other buttons (blue, green, red, purple) have been pressed fewer times, and their average rewards are lower but could potentially be higher if explored more.

3. **Uncertainty in Rewards**: The blue button has an average reward of 0.3333 based on only 6 presses, which is fewer than the yellow button. There is more uncertainty about its true reward, so exploring it further could be beneficial.

4. **Decision**: Given the high average reward of the yellow button and the need to balance exploration and exploitation, we should continue to exploit the yellow button as it has the highest known reward, but we should also consider exploring the blue button more in future steps due to its higher average reward compared to the others and fewer presses.

   - Red: 0.25 (4 presses)

2. **Key Observations**:  
   - **Yellow** has the highest average reward (0.5625) and has been pressed the most (16 times), indicating it’s a strong candidate.  
   - **Blue** has a decent average reward (0.3333) but fewer presses (6 times), so its estimate might still be uncertain.  
   - **Green**, **Red**, and **Purple** all have the same low average reward (0.25) and have been pressed equally (4 times each).  

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - While **Yellow** seems the best choice based on current data, it’s worth exploring **Blue** further since it has fewer presses and a higher average reward than the others (except Yellow).  
   - However, since the goal is to maximize total reward over 100 time steps, and we’ve already pressed Yellow 16 times with consistent high rewards, it’s safer to exploit Yellow rather than explore further.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons that have given the highest rewards so far and exploring the other buttons to gather more information about their potential rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The yellow button has the highest average reward (0.5714) based on 21 presses. This suggests it might be the best button to press to maximize immediate reward.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the yellow button looks promising, we have only pressed the blue button 7 times, and its average reward (0.2857) is not significantly lower than the yellow button, especially considering the smaller sample size. The other buttons (green, red, purple) have been pressed only 4 times each and all have the same average reward (0.25), which is lower but could still be worth exploring further.

3. **Strategy**: Given that we have 60 time steps remaining, it’s still worth exploring the buttons that have been pressed fewer times to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option. However, the yellow button’s strong performance so far makes it a compelling choice for exploitation.

4. **Decision**: Since the yellow button has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, it’s a good candidate for the next press. However, to ensure we’re not overlooking other potentially better options, we should also consider pressing the blue button, which has shown a decent average reward with fewer presses.

Given the current data, the **yellow button** remains the most promising choice for maximizing immediate reward, but we should keep an eye on the blue button for future exploration.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The yellow button has the highest average reward (0.5454545454545454) based on 22 presses. This suggests that it might be the best option to maximize immediate reward.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the yellow button looks promising, we have pressed it 22 times already, which is significantly more than the other buttons. The other buttons (blue, green, red, purple) have been pressed only 4-7 times, and their average rewards are relatively low but could still be underestimates due to the small sample size.

3. **Uncertainty in Under-Explored Buttons**: The blue button, despite being pressed only 7 times, has an average reward of 0.2857142857142857, which is slightly higher than the others. However, the sample size is still small, and it might be worth exploring further to confirm its potential.

4. **Decision**: Given that we have a limited number of time steps left (59 out of 100), we should prioritize exploiting the button with the highest known reward while still allocating some trials to explore under-sampled buttons. However, since the yellow button has consistently performed well and has a larger sample size, it remains the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.

From the summary:
- **Yellow button** has the highest average reward (0.5217) and has been pressed the most (23 times), indicating it's a strong candidate for exploitation.
- **Blue button** has a lower average reward (0.2857) but has been pressed fewer times (7 times), suggesting it might still have potential.
- **Green, Red, and Purple buttons** all have the same low average reward (0.25) and have been pressed equally (4 times each), indicating they are less promising but still worth exploring further.

Given the current information, the **yellow button** is the most promising choice for exploitation, as it has consistently provided higher rewards. However, to ensure we're not missing out on potentially better options, we should also consider exploring the less-pressed buttons, especially those with higher uncertainty (like blue).

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**: The yellow button is the best-performing button so far, but we should also explore other buttons to confirm their potential.
2. **Priority for Exploration**: Among the less-pressed buttons, the blue button has a slightly higher average reward than the others, making it a better candidate for exploration.
3. **Decision**: While the yellow button is the safest choice for immediate reward, exploring the blue button could provide valuable information and potentially higher long-term rewards.

However, since the goal is to maximize the total reward over the remaining time steps, and given the yellow button's consistent performance, it's the most logical choice for now.

2. **Key Observations**:  
   - **Yellow** has the highest average reward (0.5) and a relatively large number of trials (24), making its estimate more reliable.  
   - **Blue** has a lower average reward (0.2857) but fewer trials (7), so its true mean could be higher or lower.  
   - **Green**, **Red**, and **Purple** all have the same low average reward (0.25) and very few trials (4 each), so their true means are uncertain.  

3. **Strategy**:

   - **Exploration**: Test buttons with fewer trials (e.g., Blue, Green, Red, Purple) to gather more data and potentially discover a better option.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Given that Yellow has the highest average reward and a reliable sample size, it is the best choice for maximizing immediate reward. Exploration can be done later if needed, but for now, exploiting the best-known option is optimal.

1. **Average Rewards**:  
   - Blue: 0.25 (8 presses)  
   - Green: 0.25 (4 presses)  
   - Red: 0.25 (4 presses)  
   - Yellow: 0.4 (30 presses)  
   - Purple: 0.25 (4 presses)  

2. **Observation**:  
   - The yellow button has the highest average reward (0.4) compared to the others (0.25).  
   - The yellow button has been pressed the most (30 times), which gives us more confidence in its average reward estimate.  

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - While the yellow button seems the best choice based on current data, the other buttons (blue, green, red, purple) have been pressed fewer times, leaving room for uncertainty about their true reward distributions.  
   - However, since our goal is to maximize total reward over the remaining 50 time steps, exploiting the yellow button, which has the highest known reward, is the optimal strategy.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The yellow button is the best choice based on the current data.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To make the best choice, let's analyze the data step by step:

1. **Average Rewards**:  
   - Blue: 0.25 (8 presses)  
   - Green: 0.25 (4 presses)  
   - Red: 0.25 (4 presses)  
   - Yellow: 0.325 (40 presses)  
   - Purple: 0.25 (4 presses)  

2. **Observation**:  
   - The **yellow button** has the highest average reward (0.325) among all buttons.  
   - The other buttons (blue, green, red, purple) have the same average reward (0.25), which is lower than yellow.  

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - While the yellow button has been pressed the most (40 times) and has the highest average reward, the other buttons have been pressed fewer times (4-8 times).  
   - However, since the goal is to maximize total reward over the remaining 40 time steps, it is more beneficial to exploit the button with the highest known reward rather than explore further.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The **yellow button** is the best choice based on the current data.

   - The yellow button has been pressed the most (50 times), which suggests its reward distribution is relatively well-explored.  
   - The other buttons (blue, green, red, purple) have the same average reward (0.25) but have been pressed fewer times, indicating less exploration.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since the goal is to maximize total reward, the **yellow button** is the best choice based on its higher average reward.  
   - While the other buttons have the same average reward, they have been pressed fewer times, and their true means are less certain. However, their lower average compared to yellow makes them less attractive.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The **yellow button** is the optimal choice given its higher average reward and sufficient exploration.

2. **Blue, Green, Red, Purple Buttons**: Each of these buttons has been pressed only 4 to 8 times, and all have the same average reward of 0.25. This is lower than the yellow button's average, and the small number of presses means there is more uncertainty about their true average rewards.

Given that our goal is to maximize the total reward, and considering the current data:

- The **yellow button** has the highest average reward and has been tested sufficiently to give us some confidence in its performance.
- The other buttons have lower average rewards and less data to support their potential.

   - The other buttons (blue, green, red, purple) have the same average reward of 0.25, which is lower than yellow.  

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - While the yellow button has been pressed the most (61 times) and has the highest average reward, the other buttons have been pressed fewer times (4-8 times).  
   - However, given the limited time steps remaining (19 out of 100), it is more beneficial to exploit the button with the highest known reward rather than explore further.

2. **Blue, Green, Red, Purple Buttons**: Each of these buttons has been pressed only 4 to 8 times, with an average reward of 0.25. This suggests that these buttons have not been explored enough to have a reliable estimate of their mean rewards.

Given that we have only 13 time steps left (100 - 87 = 13), our strategy should focus on maximizing the expected reward. The yellow button has the highest known average reward and has been sufficiently explored to provide a reliable estimate.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The yellow button has the highest average reward (0.3283582089552239) and has been pressed the most, making it the most reliable choice.
- The other buttons (blue, green, red, purple) have lower and less reliable average rewards due to fewer presses.
- With only 13 time steps remaining, it's not worth exploring the other buttons further, as the potential gain from discovering a higher reward is outweighed by the risk of lower rewards.

1. **Yellow Button**: It has been pressed 71 times with an average reward of 0.30985915492957744. This is the highest average reward among all buttons, and it has been pressed the most, giving us a relatively reliable estimate of its mean.

2. **Blue, Green, Red, Purple Buttons**: Each of these buttons has been pressed only 4 to 8 times, with an average reward of 0.25. Given the small number of presses, the estimates for these buttons are less reliable compared to the yellow button.

Given that we have only 9 time steps left (100 - 91 = 9), our goal is to maximize the total reward. The yellow button has shown the highest average reward and has been tested sufficiently to give us confidence in its performance.

Therefore, the best choice is to continue pressing the yellow button to maximize the expected reward.

   - Red: 0.25 (4 presses)  
   - Yellow: 0.3108 (74 presses)  
   - Purple: 0.25 (4 presses)  

2. **Observation**:  
   - The yellow button has the highest average reward (0.3108) among all buttons.  
   - The other buttons (blue, green, red, purple) have the same average reward (0.25), but they have been pressed fewer times, leaving more uncertainty about their true means.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since the yellow button has the highest observed reward and has been pressed many times, it is the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
   - Exploring other buttons (e.g., blue, green, red, purple) might reveal higher rewards, but with only 6 time steps left, exploitation is more critical than exploration.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The yellow button is the best choice given its higher average reward and the limited remaining time steps.
