A common strategy in such scenarios is to use an **exploration-exploitation** approach, where we initially explore all options to gather information before exploiting the best-performing option.

Given that all buttons have been pressed 0 times, we can start by arbitrarily choosing any button. A reasonable approach is to select buttons in a round-robin fashion or simply pick one at random. For simplicity, let's start with the **blue** button.

In a bandit problem, the goal is to balance exploration (trying new buttons to gather information) and exploitation (choosing buttons that have already shown promise). Since we have only 100 time steps, it's crucial to explore early to gather more information about the buttons' rewards.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Current Information:** Blue and green buttons have been pressed once with no reward. Red, yellow, and purple buttons are unexplored.
2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Since we have limited information, exploring an unexplored button is a good strategy to gather more data.
3. **Choosing an Unexplored Button:** Among the unexplored buttons (red, yellow, purple), any choice is equally valid since we have no prior information about their rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **red**, **yellow**, and **purple**, all with an average reward of **0.5**. These are the most promising choices based on current data.

2. **Exploration**: The **green** button has been pressed only twice and has an average reward of **0.0**, but this could be due to chance. It might be worth exploring further to confirm if its true mean is indeed low.

3. **Blue** button: It has been pressed three times with an average reward of **0.3333**, which is lower than the top performers but still worth considering if we want to gather more data.

4. **Decision**: Since **red**, **yellow**, and **purple** have the highest average rewards, we should prioritize them for exploitation. However, to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better options, we should also explore **green** or **blue** occasionally.

Given that **red**, **yellow**, and **purple** are tied, we can choose any of them. For simplicity, let’s choose **red** this time.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Red button** has the highest average reward (0.6666) among the buttons pressed more than once, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Blue button** has a moderate average reward (0.3333), but it has been pressed more times than some other buttons.  
   - **Green button** has an average reward of 0.0, which is the lowest, so it’s less appealing unless we want to explore further.  
   - **Yellow** and **Purple buttons** both have an average reward of 0.5, which is decent but not as high as the red button.  

2. **Exploration Consideration**:  
   - **Green button** has only been pressed twice, so we might want to explore it further to confirm its low reward.  
   - **Yellow** and **Purple buttons** have also been pressed only twice, so they could still have higher potential rewards.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given that the **Red button** has the highest average reward so far, it’s the best choice for exploitation.  
   - However, exploring the **Yellow** or **Purple buttons** could reveal higher rewards, as they have been pressed fewer times and have shown decent results.  

Since the **Red button** has the highest proven reward, it’s the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward. However, to balance exploration, we could also consider pressing **Yellow** or **Purple** to gather more data.

2. **Exploration**: The **blue button** has a decent average reward (0.3333) but has only been pressed 3 times.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To make the best choice, we need to balance between **exploitation** (choosing the button with the highest known average reward) and **exploration** (trying buttons with fewer presses to gather more information about their potential rewards).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Average Rewards**:
   - Blue: 0.3333 (pressed 3 times)
   - Green: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)
   - Red: 0.5556 (pressed 9 times)
   - Yellow: 0.5 (pressed 4 times)
   - Purple: 0.3333 (pressed 3 times)

2. **Exploitation**: The red button has the highest average reward (0.5556) and has been pressed the most (9 times), so it seems like a safe choice for maximizing immediate reward.

3. **Exploration**: The green button has the lowest average reward (0.0) but has only been pressed twice. It’s possible that its true reward is higher, and we need more data to confirm. Similarly, the blue and purple buttons have been pressed only 3 times each, so there’s still uncertainty about their true rewards.

4. **Decision**: Given that we have 100 time steps and are only on step 22, we still have room for exploration. However, the red button is performing well, and we should continue to exploit it to maximize rewards while also considering exploring under-sampled buttons like green, blue, or purple in future steps.

For this step, since the red button has the highest average reward and has been sufficiently explored, it’s a good choice to maximize immediate reward.

   - **Red button** has the highest average reward (0.6) and has been pressed 10 times, which is a good sample size. It seems like a reliable choice for exploitation.  
   - **Yellow button** has a decent average reward (0.5) and has been pressed 4 times, which is fewer than the red button. It could be worth exploring further.  
   - **Blue and Purple buttons** have the same average reward (0.3333) but have been pressed only 3 times each. They might be worth exploring more.  
   - **Green button** has an average reward of 0.0 and has been pressed only 2 times. It seems less promising but could still be worth exploring to confirm its low reward.

2. **Prioritizing Choices**:  
   - **Red button** is the most promising based on current data, but we should also consider exploring other buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options.  
   - Given that we have 78 remaining time steps, we can afford to explore a bit more while still exploiting the best-known option.  

3. **Decision**:

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Observations:**
   - **Red button:** Pressed 16 times, average reward 0.5. This is a reliable choice but not the highest average reward.
   - **Yellow button:** Pressed 5 times, average reward 0.6. This has the highest average reward so far but with fewer trials, so its true mean could be lower.
   - **Blue and Purple buttons:** Both pressed 3 times with average reward 0.3333. These are less promising based on current data.
   - **Green button:** Pressed 3 times with average reward 0.0. This seems the least promising.

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration:**
   - **Yellow button** has the highest average reward but fewer trials. It’s worth exploring further to confirm its potential.
   - **Red button** is a safer choice but may not yield the highest possible reward.
   - **Blue, Purple, and Green buttons** have lower average rewards and fewer trials, but exploring them more could reveal hidden potential.

3. **Decision:**
   - Given the high average reward of the **yellow button** and the need to confirm its potential, it’s a good candidate for the next choice.
   - However, since we’ve only pressed it 5 times, there’s still uncertainty about its true mean. Pressing it again will help reduce this uncertainty.

1. **Exploitation Analysis**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed 16 times, indicating it’s a reliable choice.  
   - The **yellow button** also has an average reward of 0.5 but has only been pressed 6 times, suggesting it might be worth exploring further.  

2. **Exploration Analysis**:  
   - The **blue** and **purple buttons** have been pressed only 3 times each, with an average reward of 0.3333. This is lower than red and yellow, but they haven’t been explored enough to rule them out completely.  
   - The **green button** has an average reward of 0.0 after 3 presses, making it the least promising so far.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since the **red button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, it’s a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - However, the **yellow button** has the same average reward but fewer presses, making it a good candidate for further exploration to confirm its potential.  

Given the goal of maximizing total reward, **red** is the safer choice, but **yellow** could yield higher rewards if its true mean is higher than red’s. Since we’re early in the 100 time steps (only 31 steps completed), it’s worth exploring **yellow** further.

2. **Exploration Analysis**:  
   - **Blue**, **green**, and **purple buttons** have been pressed only 3 times each. Their average rewards are not very informative yet (0.3333 for blue and purple, 0.0 for green).  
   - **Green button** has an average reward of 0.0, which is concerning, but it’s based on only 3 trials. It’s worth exploring further to confirm if it’s truly a bad choice.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Red button** is the safest choice for exploitation, but we also need to explore other buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options.  
   - **Green button** is the least explored and has the lowest average reward so far, but it’s worth trying again to gather more data.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To make the best choice, we need to balance between **exploitation** (choosing the button with the highest known average reward) and **exploration** (trying buttons with fewer presses to gather more information about their potential rewards).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed the most (22 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: The **blue**, **green**, **yellow**, and **purple** buttons have been pressed fewer times, and their average rewards are lower but could potentially be higher if explored further. However, given the limited time steps remaining (60 out of 100), exploration should be strategic.

3. **Strategic Exploration**: The **yellow button** has the second-highest average reward (0.375) and has been pressed only 8 times. It’s a good candidate for exploration because it has potential to be as good as or better than the red button, but we need more data to confirm.

4. **Decision**: Since the **red button** is the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward, and we still have enough time steps to explore other buttons later, it’s the best choice for now.

4. **Strategy**: Given that we have 50 time steps remaining, it's a good idea to balance exploitation (choosing the best-known option) with exploration (trying under-explored options). However, since the red button has a clear lead and has been tested extensively, it remains a strong choice.

Considering the above analysis, the red button is still the most promising option based on current data.

   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.4063) and has been pressed the most (32 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice.  
   - The **blue**, **yellow**, and **purple** buttons have similar average rewards (0.3333) but have been pressed fewer times (3-9 times), suggesting they might have higher potential if explored further.  
   - The **green button** has the lowest average reward (0.25) and has been pressed 4 times, making it less attractive.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since the red button has the highest average reward and has been sufficiently explored, it’s a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing buttons with fewer trials (like blue, yellow, or purple) to gather more data and potentially find a better option.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.3902) and has been pressed the most (41 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice.  
   - The **blue**, **yellow**, and **purple buttons** have fewer presses and similar average rewards (0.3333). They could potentially yield higher rewards but are less explored.  
   - The **green button** has the lowest average reward (0.25) and is not a good candidate.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 40 time steps left, we should focus on **exploitation** (choosing the best-known option) rather than exploration.  
   - The **red button** is the best-known option with the highest average reward.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 30 time steps, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons that have shown the highest average rewards so far and exploring the buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information about their potential rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performing Button**: The red button has the highest average reward (0.4) and has been pressed the most (50 times), indicating a relatively stable estimate of its reward distribution.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the red button is the best performer, the blue and purple buttons have been pressed only 3 times each, and their average rewards (0.3333) are not significantly lower than the red button. Given that we still have 30 time steps left, it’s worth exploring these buttons further to see if they might yield higher rewards.

3. **Least Explored Buttons**: The blue and purple buttons are the least explored, and their average rewards are promising. Exploring them could potentially reveal higher reward distributions.

4. **Decision**: Given the need to balance exploration and exploitation, and considering the remaining time steps, it’s a good strategy to explore one of the least pressed buttons with a decent average reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Red button**: Pressed 50 times with an average reward of 0.4. This is the most explored button, and its average reward is decent but not the highest.  
   - **Blue button**: Pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is the highest average reward observed, but it’s based on very few samples, so it might be an overestimate.  
   - **Green button**: Pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.25. This is the lowest average reward observed, and it’s not worth exploring further unless we suspect it might improve.  
   - **Yellow button**: Pressed 10 times with an average reward of 0.3. This is moderately explored, but the reward is lower than the red and blue buttons.  
   - **Purple button**: Pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.3333. This is the least explored button, and its average reward is slightly higher than yellow but lower than red and blue.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we have only 29 time steps left (100 - 71 = 29), we should prioritize exploring buttons with high potential rewards that have been under-explored. The **blue button** has the highest observed average reward but has been pressed only 4 times, so it’s worth exploring further to confirm its true mean.  

3. **Decision**:  
   Given the high potential of the blue button and the limited exploration so far, it’s a good candidate for the next press.

1. **Exploitation**: Based on the average rewards, the **blue button** has the highest average reward of 0.6, although it has only been pressed 5 times. The **red button**, which has been pressed 50 times, has an average reward of 0.4, which is lower than the blue button but has more data to support its average.

2. **Exploration**: The **purple button** has been pressed only 3 times and has an average reward of 0.3333, which is not significantly lower than the other buttons. It might be worth exploring further to see if it can yield higher rewards. Similarly, the **green button** and **yellow button** have been pressed relatively fewer times (4 and 10, respectively) and might also be worth exploring.

3. **Decision**: Given that the **blue button** has the highest average reward so far, even though it has been pressed fewer times, it seems like a good candidate for exploitation. However, to ensure we are not missing out on potentially higher rewards from less explored buttons, we should also consider exploring the **purple button** or **green button**.

Given the limited time steps remaining (28 out of 100), it's crucial to maximize the expected reward. The **blue button** has shown the highest potential so far, and pressing it more could lead to higher total rewards.

1. **Current Best Performer**: The red button has the highest average reward of 0.39215686274509803, based on 51 presses. This suggests that the red button might have the highest mean reward among all buttons.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Since we have only 24 time steps left (100 - 76 = 24), we need to balance between exploiting the best-known option (red button) and exploring other buttons to gather more information about their potential rewards.

3. **Under-Explored Buttons**: The purple button has been pressed only 3 times, and the green button has been pressed 4 times. These buttons have not been explored enough to confidently determine their true reward means. The blue and yellow buttons have been pressed more frequently but still have fewer presses compared to the red button.

4. **Strategy**: Given the limited time steps remaining, it's crucial to focus on the buttons that have shown promising results while also exploring the under-explored buttons to avoid missing out on potentially better options.

Considering the above points:
- The red button is the current best performer and should be a strong candidate for exploitation.
- The purple button, with only 3 presses, is the most under-explored and deserves further investigation.

Given the need to maximize total reward and the limited time, the best strategy is to continue exploiting the red button while allocating a few presses to explore the purple button. However, since we need to choose only one button for this time step, and the red button has proven to be the most rewarding so far, it is the safer and more rewarding choice.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.4) and has been pressed the most (55 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice.  
   - The **blue button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.375) but has been pressed only 8 times, suggesting it might have more potential if its true mean is higher.  
   - The **green**, **yellow**, and **purple** buttons have lower average rewards and fewer presses, making them less attractive for exploitation but worth exploring further.

2. **Remaining Time Steps**:  
   With only 20 time steps left, the focus should be more on exploitation rather than exploration, as there’s limited time to benefit from discovering better options.

3. **Decision**:  
   - The **red button** is the safest choice given its high average reward and reliability.  
   - However, the **blue button** has a close average reward and has been under-explored, so it’s worth pressing a few more times to confirm its potential.  

Given the limited time and the need to maximize rewards, the **red button** is the best choice for now.

2. **Remaining Time Steps**:

3. **Decision**:  
   - The **red button** is the most reliable choice based on its high average reward and the number of times it has been pressed.  
   - While the **blue button** has a slightly lower average reward, it has been pressed significantly fewer times, and exploring it further could potentially reveal a higher reward. However, with only 18 time steps left, the risk of not gaining a higher reward outweighs the potential benefit.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 11 time steps, we need to consider both the average rewards observed so far and the uncertainty in those estimates, especially for buttons that have been pressed fewer times. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Average Rewards**:  
   - Red: 0.4 (60 presses)  
   - Purple: 0.42857 (7 presses)  
   - Blue: 0.375 (8 presses)  
   - Yellow: 0.3 (10 presses)  
   - Green: 0.25 (4 presses)  

2. **Uncertainty in Estimates**:  
   Buttons with fewer presses (purple, blue, green, yellow) have higher uncertainty in their average reward estimates compared to the red button, which has been pressed 60 times.  

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   Since we only have 11 time steps left, we should prioritize exploitation (choosing the button with the highest expected reward) rather than exploration (testing buttons with high uncertainty).  

4. **Best Choice**:  
   The purple button has the highest average reward (0.42857) among all buttons, despite being pressed only 7 times. Given the limited time left, it’s the best choice to maximize the total reward.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The red button has been explored extensively, and its reward seems stable.  
   - Other buttons (blue, purple, yellow) have fewer presses and might still have potential, but their average rewards are lower than red's.  
   - The green button has the lowest average reward and has been pressed only 4 times, so it’s less likely to be optimal.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Average Rewards**:
   - **Red**: 0.4057971014492754 (highest average reward)
   - **Blue**: 0.375
   - **Purple**: 0.375
   - **Green**: 0.25
   - **Yellow**: 0.3

2. **Number of Trials**:
   - **Red**: 69 trials (most explored)
   - **Yellow**: 10 trials
   - **Blue**: 8 trials
   - **Purple**: 8 trials
   - **Green**: 4 trials (least explored)

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, indicating it’s a reliable choice for exploitation.
   - The **green button** has the lowest average reward but has been pressed the least, suggesting it might still have potential for higher rewards if explored further.

4. **Decision**:
   - Given that this is the 100th and final time step, the goal is to maximize the immediate reward. The **red button** has consistently provided the highest average reward, making it the safest and most rewarding choice.
