A common strategy in such scenarios is to use an **exploration-exploitation** approach, where we initially explore all options to gather information before exploiting the best-performing option.

Given that all buttons have been pressed 0 times, we can start by arbitrarily choosing any button. A simple and fair approach is to select buttons in a round-robin fashion or randomly. Since no button has been pressed yet, we can start with any color.

In a bandit problem, the goal is to balance exploration (trying new buttons to gather information) and exploitation (choosing buttons that have already shown promise). Since we have only 100 time steps, it's crucial to explore early to gather more information about the buttons' rewards.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Current Information:** Blue and green buttons have been pressed once with no reward. Red, yellow, and purple buttons are unexplored.
2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Since we have limited information, exploring an unexplored button is a good strategy to gather more data.
3. **Choosing an Unexplored Button:** Among the unexplored buttons (red, yellow, purple), any choice is equally valid since we have no prior information about their rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **yellow button** has the highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed 6 times, which is a decent number of trials to trust its average. It seems like the best choice for immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: The **red**, **green**, and **purple buttons** have only been pressed once each, and their average rewards are 0.0. This could be due to bad luck, or they might genuinely have low reward probabilities. We need to explore these buttons more to confirm their true potential.

3. **Balancing Act**: While the **yellow button** is the safest choice for immediate reward, we should also explore the other buttons to avoid missing out on potentially better options. However, since we only have 100 time steps, we need to be strategic about when to explore.

4. **Decision**: Given that we’re only 12 time steps in, it’s still early in the game. We can afford to explore a bit more. However, the **yellow button** has shown the most promise so far, and pressing it again is a safe bet to maximize immediate reward.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While yellow seems promising, we have only pressed the green, red, and purple buttons once each, and their average rewards are 0.0.

   - **Blue** has a decent average reward (0.5) but has been pressed fewer times compared to Yellow.  
   - **Green** and **Red** have similar, lower average rewards and fewer presses.  

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   While Yellow seems the best based on current data, it’s important to explore other buttons to confirm their true reward distributions. However, since we only have 100 time steps, exploiting the best-known option (Yellow) is a safer strategy to maximize total reward.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Given the high average reward and sufficient exploration of Yellow, it’s the best choice for now.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Observations**:
   - **Yellow** has the highest average reward (0.5555) and has been pressed 9 times.
   - **Blue** has a good average reward (0.5) but has only been pressed 4 times.
   - **Green** and **Red** have similar average rewards (0.3333) and have been pressed 3 times each.
   - **Purple** has the lowest average reward (0.0) and has been pressed 3 times.

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:
   - **Yellow** is the best choice based on current data, but we should also explore other buttons to confirm their true reward distributions.
   - **Blue** has a promising average reward but hasn't been pressed enough to be certain.
   - **Purple** has a very low average reward, but it has only been pressed 3 times, so it might be worth exploring further.

3. **Decision**:
   - **Yellow** is the safest choice for exploitation, but we should also explore **Blue** or **Purple** to gather more data.
   - Given that **Purple** has the lowest average reward but hasn't been explored much, it's a good candidate for exploration.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we should focus on choosing the button that has yielded the highest average reward so far, while also considering the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the average rewards**:  
   - **Yellow button**: 0.4666 (highest average reward)  
   - **Blue button**: 0.4 (second highest, but fewer samples)  
   - **Green button**: 0.3333  
   - **Red button**: 0.3333  
   - **Purple button**: 0.2 (lowest average reward)  

2. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**:  
   - The yellow button has the highest average reward and has been pressed 15 times, which is a reasonable number of samples to trust its performance.  
   - The blue button has a slightly lower average reward but fewer samples (5 times), so it might still be worth exploring.  
   - The green, red, and purple buttons have lower average rewards and fewer samples, but they could still be worth exploring to ensure we’re not missing a better option.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since the yellow button has the highest average reward and a decent number of samples, it is the safest choice for exploitation.  
   - However, to balance exploration, we could occasionally try the blue button, as it has a promising average reward with fewer samples.  

Given the goal of maximizing total reward, the **yellow button** is the best choice at this step, as it has the highest proven average reward.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The yellow button has the highest average reward (0.47368421052631576) based on 19 presses. This suggests that it might be the best button to press to maximize immediate rewards.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the yellow button seems promising, we have pressed it significantly more than the other buttons. The blue button, with an average reward of 0.4 over 5 presses, also looks promising and could potentially have a higher true mean reward. The red and green buttons have similar average rewards (0.3333333333333333) but have been pressed only 3 times each, so they might still have untapped potential. The purple button has the lowest average reward (0.2) and has been pressed 5 times, making it less attractive.

3. **Strategy**: Given that we have 65 more time steps left, we should continue to explore the buttons that haven't been pressed as much to gather more data, while also exploiting the buttons that have shown good performance.

**Decision**: 
- The yellow button is the current best performer, but we should also give more chances to the blue button to confirm its potential.
- The red and green buttons, with fewer presses, deserve more exploration.
- The purple button, with the lowest average reward, is the least attractive option at this point.

Given the current data, the **yellow button** remains the best choice for immediate reward maximization, but to balance exploration and exploitation, we should also consider giving more chances to the **blue button**.

   - The **blue button** has been pressed only 6 times, and its average reward (0.3333) is lower than yellow but still decent. It might be worth exploring further.  
   - The **green** and **red buttons** have been pressed only 3 times each, with the same average reward as blue (0.3333). These could also be worth exploring.  
   - The **purple button** has the lowest average reward (0.2) and has been pressed 5 times. It seems less promising but still deserves some exploration.

3. **Balancing Exploitation and Exploration:**  
   Since we have 60 time steps remaining, we can afford to explore more. However, the **yellow button** has already been pressed 23 times, and its average reward is significantly higher than the others. It’s a strong candidate for exploitation.

4. **Decision:**  
   Given the high average reward of the **yellow button** and the fact that we still have many time steps left, it’s a good choice to continue exploiting it while occasionally exploring other buttons.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The yellow button has the highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed the most (24 times). This suggests it might be the best option for exploitation.

2. **Exploration Consideration**: The red button has a high average reward (0.3333) but has only been pressed 3 times. This means there is still a lot of uncertainty about its true reward distribution. Exploring it further could be beneficial.

3. **Other Buttons**: 
   - The blue button has a moderate average reward (0.3333) and has been pressed 6 times. It’s a decent option but not as promising as yellow or red.
   - The green button has a lower average reward (0.25) and has been pressed 4 times. It’s less attractive.
   - The purple button has the lowest average reward (0.2) and has been pressed 5 times. It’s the least attractive option.

4. **Decision**: Given the high reward of the yellow button and the need to explore the red button further, we should prioritize between these two. Since the yellow button has already been pressed many times and has a high reward, it’s a safer choice for exploitation. However, exploring the red button could potentially yield even higher rewards if its true mean is higher than currently estimated.

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, and considering the high reward of the yellow button, the best choice for this step is to **exploit the yellow button** to maximize immediate reward while still keeping in mind the need to explore other options in future steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **yellow button** has the highest average reward (0.4643) and has been pressed the most (28 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
2. **Exploration**: The **blue button** has a decent average reward (0.3333) but has only been pressed 6 times, so there’s potential for it to perform better or worse than expected. Similarly, the **red button** has a high average reward (0.4286) but has only been pressed 7 times, so it’s worth exploring further.  
3. **Under-explored buttons**: The **green button** (pressed 4 times) and **purple button** (pressed 5 times) have lower average rewards (0.25 and 0.2, respectively) and are less explored, but their true potential is still uncertain.

Given that we’re halfway through the 100 time steps, we should prioritize **exploitation** to maximize total reward while still leaving room for exploration later. The **yellow button** is the safest bet for now, as it has the highest average reward and has been sufficiently tested.

   - **Yellow button**: Pressed 29 times with an average reward of 0.4483. This is the highest average reward so far.

   - **Blue button**: Pressed 6 times with an average reward of 0.3333. It has a decent reward but has been pressed relatively few times.
   - **Green button**: Pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.25. It has a lower reward but is even less explored.
   - **Purple button**: Pressed 5 times with an average reward of 0.2. It has the lowest average reward and is also less explored.

3. **Strategy**:
   - **Exploitation**: The yellow button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, so it’s a safe bet for maximizing immediate reward.
   - **Exploration**: The blue, green, and purple buttons have been pressed fewer times, and their true reward potential is less certain. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.

Given that we are only 51 time steps in and have 49 more to go, it’s still beneficial to explore under-explored buttons to a certain extent. However, since the yellow button has consistently provided the highest rewards, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Current Average Rewards**:
   - **Yellow**: 0.4167 (pressed 36 times)
   - **Red**: 0.375 (pressed 8 times)
   - **Blue**: 0.2857 (pressed 7 times)
   - **Green**: 0.25 (pressed 4 times)
   - **Purple**: 0.2 (pressed 5 times)

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:
   - **Yellow** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Red** has a high average reward but has been pressed fewer times, suggesting it might be worth exploring further.
   - **Blue**, **Green**, and **Purple** have lower average rewards and have been pressed fewer times, making them less attractive for exploitation but still worth considering for exploration.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Given that we have 40 time steps remaining (100 - 60), we should focus on exploiting the button with the highest average reward while also exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options.

4. **Decision**:
   - **Yellow** is the most promising button based on current data, but we should also consider **Red** due to its high average reward and fewer presses.
   - To balance exploitation and exploration, we’ll choose **Yellow** for now, as it has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be a reliable choice.

   - The **purple button** has been pressed only 5 times with an average reward of 0.2, the lowest so far. It’s worth exploring to see if it has hidden potential.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - The **red button** is the most promising for exploitation, but we’ve already pressed it 12 times, so its reward distribution is relatively well-understood.  
   - The **yellow button** is over-explored, so pressing it again might not yield much additional reward.  
   - The **blue button** and **green button** are moderately explored and could still yield better rewards.  
   - The **purple button** is the least explored and has the lowest average reward, but it’s worth trying again to confirm its potential.  

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, the **red button** is still the best choice for maximizing immediate reward, but we should also consider exploring the **purple button** to gather more data. However, since we’re aiming to maximize total reward and the red button has the highest known reward, we’ll prioritize it.

1. **Current Average Rewards:**
   - **Red button:** 0.5384615384615384 (highest average reward)

   - **Green button:** 0.25
   - **Purple button:** 0.2 (lowest average reward)

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation:**
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed 13 times, which is a reasonable number of trials to have confidence in its average.
   - The **yellow button** has a good average reward and has been pressed the most (41 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice but not the best so far.
   - The **blue button** has a moderate average reward but has only been pressed 7 times, so there’s still some uncertainty about its true mean.
   - The **green button** has a low average reward and has only been pressed 4 times, so it might be worth exploring further.
   - The **purple button** has the lowest average reward and has been pressed 5 times, but it’s still worth exploring a bit more to confirm its low performance.

3. **Decision:**
   - **Exploitation:** The **red button** is the best choice based on current data.
   - **Exploration:** The **green** and **purple** buttons have been pressed fewer times and could potentially yield higher rewards than their current averages suggest.

Given that we have 30 time steps left (100 - 70 = 30), it’s still beneficial to explore the less-pressed buttons to a degree, but the primary focus should be on exploiting the best-known option to maximize rewards.

**Final Decision:**  
Given the high average reward of the **red button** and the remaining time steps, it’s the best choice to maximize the total reward.

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we have 22 time steps left, we should focus on exploring the buttons with fewer presses to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially higher rewards. The **blue** and **green** buttons are the best candidates for exploration.

3. **Choosing the Next Button**:  
   Between **blue** and **green**, **blue** has a slightly higher average reward and has been pressed more times, making it a safer choice for exploration.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Red button** has the highest average reward (0.5714) but has been pressed 21 times, which is a decent number of trials.  
   - **Yellow button** has a lower average reward (0.4390) but has been pressed the most (41 times), indicating it’s been well-explored.  
   - **Blue button** has a moderate average reward (0.375) but has only been pressed 8 times, suggesting it might be worth exploring further.  
   - **Green button** has a low average reward (0.25) and has been pressed only 4 times, so it might still have potential.  
   - **Purple button** has the lowest average reward (0.2) and has been pressed 5 times, making it the least promising.

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we have only 21 time steps left (100 - 79 = 21), we should focus on exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times but show some potential. The **blue button** stands out as a good candidate because it has a moderate average reward and has been pressed only 8 times.

3. **Decision**:  
   Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, pressing the **blue button** next seems like a reasonable choice to gather more data and potentially increase the total reward.

1. **Current Average Rewards:**
   - **Red button:** 0.5714 (highest average reward, pressed 21 times)

   - **Purple button:** 0.2 (pressed 5 times)

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration:**
   - **Red button** has the highest average reward, but it has been pressed 21 times, which is a reasonable number of trials to estimate its mean.
   - **Yellow button** has a lower average reward than the red button but has been pressed the most (41 times), indicating a stable estimate.
   - **Blue button** has a moderate average reward and has been pressed fewer times (9 times), so there’s still some uncertainty about its true mean.
   - **Green button** and **Purple button** have been pressed the least (4 and 5 times, respectively) and have lower average rewards, suggesting they might be worth exploring further.

3. **Strategy:**
   - Since we have only 20 time steps left, we should prioritize buttons with higher average rewards to maximize immediate gains.
   - However, we should also allocate a few trials to the less-pressed buttons (green and purple) to confirm their low rewards or potentially discover higher rewards.

4. **Decision:**
   - Given the high average reward and reasonable number of trials, the **Red button** is the best choice for exploitation.
   - We should also consider exploring **Green** or **Purple** buttons, but given the limited time, focusing on the highest reward button is more prudent.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons that have given the highest average rewards so far and exploring the buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information about their potential rewards.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:
   - **Red button**: Highest average reward (0.5862) with 29 presses. This is the most promising button based on current data.
   - **Yellow button**: Second-highest average reward (0.4390) with 41 presses. It’s a strong contender but slightly less rewarding than red.
   - **Blue button**: Average reward (0.3333) with only 9 presses. It has potential but needs more exploration.
   - **Green button**: Average reward (0.25) with 4 presses. It’s under-explored but has a lower average reward so far.
   - **Purple button**: Lowest average reward (0.2) with 5 presses. It’s under-explored but has shown the least promise.

2. **Current Strategy**:
   - Since we have only 12 time steps left (100 - 88 = 12), we should focus more on **exploitation** rather than exploration, as we don’t have enough time to significantly improve our understanding of the under-explored buttons.
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward and is the safest choice to maximize immediate rewards.

3. **Final Decision**:
   - Given the limited time and the red button's consistently high average reward, it’s the best choice to maximize the total reward.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we should focus on choosing the button with the highest expected reward based on the observed averages. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the average rewards**:  
   - Blue: 0.3333 (9 presses)  
   - Green: 0.25 (4 presses)  
   - Red: 0.5641 (39 presses)  
   - Yellow: 0.4390 (41 presses)  
   - Purple: 0.2 (5 presses)  

2. **Identify the button with the highest average reward**:  
   The **red button** has the highest average reward of 0.5641.  

3. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**:  
   Since we only have 2 time steps left (98 out of 100), exploiting the button with the highest known reward is the best strategy.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The **red button** is the optimal choice to maximize the total reward.

Each button is associated with a Bernoulli distribution with a fixed but unknown mean; the means for the buttons could be different. For each button, when you press it, you will get a reward that is sampled from the button's associated distribution. You have 100 time steps and, on each time step, you can choose any button and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps.

At each time step, I will show you a summary of your past choices and rewards. Then you must make the next choice, which must be exactly one of blue, red, green, yellow, purple.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward, we should choose the button with the highest expected reward based on the observed averages. Let's analyze the data step by step:

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 9 times, average reward = 0.3333.  
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 4 times, average reward = 0.25.  
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 40 times, average reward = 0.575.  
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 41 times, average reward = 0.4390.  
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 5 times, average reward = 0.2.  

The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.575), making it the best choice to maximize the total reward on this final time step.
