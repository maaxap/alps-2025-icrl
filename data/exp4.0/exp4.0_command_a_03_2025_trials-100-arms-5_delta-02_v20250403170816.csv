Given that all buttons have been pressed 0 times, we can start by arbitrarily choosing any button. A simple and fair approach is to select buttons in a round-robin fashion or randomly. Since no button has been pressed yet, we can start with any color.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. This is a small sample size, and the reward could be higher or lower with more trials.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. Similar to the green button, more data is needed to determine its true reward potential.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.8) and has been pressed 5 times. This suggests it is a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.
   
2. **Exploration**: The **green**, **red**, and **purple** buttons have been pressed only 1 or 2 times, and their average rewards are currently 0.0. This could mean they are low-reward buttons, but it’s also possible that we haven’t explored them enough to know their true potential.

3. **Yellow Button**: The **yellow button** has an average reward of 0.5, which is lower than the blue button but higher than the others. It has been pressed 2 times, so there’s still some uncertainty about its true reward.

4. **Strategy**: Since we have 89 time steps remaining, we can afford to explore a bit more while still prioritizing exploitation. However, the blue button’s high average reward makes it the safest and most rewarding choice at this stage.

**Decision**: Given the current information, the **blue button** is the best choice to maximize immediate reward while we continue to gather more data on the other buttons.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. This is a very small sample size, so we cannot be confident about its true mean.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.0. Similar to the green button, the sample size is small, but the average reward is not promising.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. This button has a moderate average reward, but the sample size is still small.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. Again, the sample size is too small to draw conclusions.

- The **blue button** has the highest average reward and a relatively large sample size, making it the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

### Analysis:
1. **Blue Button**:  
   - Pressed 15 times with an average reward of **0.6666666666666666**.  
   - This is the highest average reward observed so far, making it the most promising choice for exploitation.

2. **Green Button**:  
   - Pressed 1 time with an average reward of **0.0**.  
   - Very limited data, so it could still have a higher mean. Needs exploration.

3. **Red Button**:  
   - Pressed 2 times with an average reward of **0.0**.  
   - Limited data, but the observed rewards are low. Less promising than blue but still worth exploring.

4. **Yellow Button**:  
   - Pressed 2 times with an average reward of **0.5**.  
   - Moderate reward, but less than blue. Could be explored further.

5. **Purple Button**:  
   - Pressed 1 time with an average reward of **0.0**.  
   - Very limited data, so it could still have a higher mean. Needs exploration.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The blue button has the highest average reward and is the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
- **Exploration**: The green, red, and purple buttons have very limited data, so exploring them could reveal higher rewards.  

Given that we have only 21 out of 100 time steps completed, there is still ample opportunity to explore. However, since the blue button has a significantly higher average reward, it is reasonable to exploit it further while gradually exploring other buttons.

### Decision:
For this time step, we will **exploit** the blue button to maximize the immediate reward while keeping in mind the need to explore other buttons in future steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button**: Pressed 18 times with an average reward of 0.5556. This is a solid choice based on past data, but it might not be the best.  
   - **Yellow button**: Pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.6667. This is the highest average reward so far, but it’s based on fewer samples, so it could be an even better choice or just lucky.  
   - **Red, Green, Purple buttons**: Pressed 1-2 times with average rewards of 0.0. These buttons have not shown any reward yet, but they could still have higher means; we need more data.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   - Since we’re only 25 time steps in (out of 100), it’s still early to fully exploit the best-known button. We should explore the less-pressed buttons to gather more information.  
   - The **yellow button** has shown the highest average reward so far, but it’s based on only 3 presses. It’s worth pressing again to confirm its potential.  
   - The **red, green, and purple buttons** have been pressed very few times and have shown no reward. We should explore these to see if they have higher means than what we’ve observed.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high average reward of the **yellow button** and the need to confirm its potential, it’s a strong candidate.  
   - However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing one of the under-explored buttons (red, green, or purple).  

Since the **yellow button** has the highest average reward so far and needs more data to confirm its potential, it’s the best choice for this step.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 18 times with an average reward of 0.5556. This is a relatively high average reward, but it's based on a large number of trials, so the uncertainty is lower compared to other buttons with fewer trials.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. The single trial with no reward doesn't provide much information, so there's high uncertainty about its true mean reward.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.0. Similar to the green button, the lack of rewards in the few trials doesn't give us much confidence in its true mean reward.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.75. This is the highest average reward observed so far, but it's based on fewer trials compared to the blue button. There's still some uncertainty, but it looks promising.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. Like the green button, there's high uncertainty due to the limited data.

**Strategy**: 
- The **yellow button** has shown the highest average reward so far, even though it's based on fewer trials. Given its high reward potential, it's worth exploring further to confirm its true mean reward.
- The **blue button** is a safer choice with a known decent reward, but we've already explored it extensively.
- The other buttons (green, red, purple) have shown no rewards yet, but they could still have higher means; however, the risk is higher due to the lack of positive data.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation Analysis**:
   - **Blue button**: Pressed 21 times with an average reward of 0.476. This is the most frequently pressed button and has a decent average reward.
   - **Yellow button**: Pressed 6 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is the highest average reward so far, but it has been pressed fewer times compared to the blue button.

2. **Exploration Analysis**:
   - **Green button**: Pressed only 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. It hasn’t been explored much, so its true potential is still unknown.
   - **Red button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.0. Similar to the green button, it hasn’t been explored much.
   - **Purple button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. Also under-explored.

3. **Decision**:
   - The **yellow button** has the highest average reward so far (0.5), but it has been pressed only 6 times. It’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - The **blue button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.476) but has been pressed 21 times, indicating more reliable data.
   - The **green, red, and purple buttons** are under-explored and could potentially have higher rewards, but we don’t have enough data to confirm this.

Given that we still have 69 time steps left, it’s a good strategy to **exploit the yellow button** since it has the highest average reward so far, while also keeping in mind that we should explore the under-pressed buttons (green, red, purple) in future steps.

From the summary:

- **Blue button**: Pressed 21 times with an average reward of 0.476. This is a relatively high number of presses, and the average reward is decent but not the highest.
- **Green button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. This button has been pressed very little, and we have no evidence of its potential reward.
- **Red button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.0. Similar to the green button, this one has been pressed very little and has shown no reward.
- **Yellow button**: Pressed 7 times with an average reward of 0.571. This button has the highest average reward so far, but it has been pressed fewer times compared to the blue button.
- **Purple button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. Like the green and red buttons, this one has been pressed very little and has shown no reward.

**Strategy**:
- **Exploitation**: The yellow button has the highest average reward, so it's a strong candidate for exploitation.
- **Exploration**: The green, red, and purple buttons have been pressed very little, and we don't have enough information about their potential rewards. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.

Given that we have 68 time steps remaining (100 - 32 = 68), we can afford to explore a bit more while still exploiting the best-known option. However, since the yellow button has shown the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, it's a good choice to continue exploiting it to maximize immediate rewards.

   - Purple: 0.0 (pressed 1 time)  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The **green button** has the highest average reward (0.75), but it has been pressed only 4 times, so there is uncertainty about its true mean.  
   - The **blue button** has a decent average reward (0.476) and has been pressed 21 times, making its estimate more reliable.  
   - The **yellow button** has a moderate average reward (0.5) and has been pressed 12 times, making it a safer but less promising choice.  
   - The **red** and **purple buttons** have low or zero rewards and have been pressed very few times, so they are less attractive.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - The **green button** is the most promising based on its high average reward, but it needs more exploration to confirm its true mean.  
   - Given the goal of maximizing total reward, it’s worth pressing the **green button** again to gather more data and potentially exploit its high reward if it proves consistent.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation Analysis**:
   - **Blue button**: Pressed 21 times with an average reward of 0.476. This is a decent reward, but it’s not the highest.
   - **Green button**: Pressed 6 times with an average reward of 0.667. This is the highest average reward so far, but it’s based on fewer trials, so there’s uncertainty.
   - **Yellow button**: Pressed 12 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is a solid reward but lower than the green button.
   - **Red button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.0. This seems poor, but it’s based on very few trials.
   - **Purple button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. Similar to the red button, it’s based on very little data.

2. **Exploration Analysis**:
   - **Red and Purple buttons** have been pressed very few times, so their true reward potential is still uncertain. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.
   - **Green button** has the highest average reward but is based on only 6 trials, so further exploration could confirm or adjust its potential.

3. **Decision**:
   - The **green button** has the highest average reward so far, but it’s based on limited data. It’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - The **red and purple buttons** are worth exploring because they’ve been pressed very few times and could have higher rewards than currently observed.

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, and considering the high average reward of the green button with limited data, the best choice is to **exploit the green button** to confirm its potential while still keeping an eye on exploration in future steps.

   - **Purple button**: Pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.333. Similar to red, it has been explored very little but shows some potential.

2. **Decision**:  
   - **Green** has the highest average reward so far, but it’s worth exploring **red** and **purple** more since they have been pressed only 3 times each and could have higher rewards than currently observed.  
   - However, since we’re aiming to maximize total reward and we only have 52 remaining steps, it’s safer to focus on buttons with proven higher rewards while still exploring under-explored buttons occasionally.

3. **Final Choice**:  
   Given the current data, **green** is the best choice for exploitation, but **red** and **purple** need more exploration. Since **green** has the highest average reward and has been pressed fewer times than blue, it’s a good balance between exploitation and exploration.

   - **Red button**: Pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.0. This is the lowest average reward, but it has been pressed the least, so it might be worth exploring more.  
   - **Purple button**: Pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.333. Similar to red, it has been pressed the least, but its average reward is higher than red’s.  

2. **Decision**:  
   - **Green and Yellow** are tied for the highest average reward, but green has been pressed fewer times, making it a better candidate for exploration to confirm its potential.  
   - **Red and Purple** have been pressed the least, but their average rewards are lower. Exploring them further is risky but could yield higher rewards if their true means are higher than observed.  

3. **Final Choice**:

   - **Blue button**: Pressed 21 times with an average reward of 0.476. This is a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Green button**: Pressed 11 times with an average reward of 0.454. Slightly lower than blue but still a decent option.

   - **Purple button**: Pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.333. Similar to red, it could be worth exploring further.

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   - The red and purple buttons have been pressed only 3 times each, which is insufficient to conclude their true potential. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.  
   - However, since we only have 50 time steps left, we need to balance exploration with exploitation.

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Yellow button** has the highest average reward so far (0.5) and has been pressed a moderate number of times (12). It’s a safe and promising choice for exploitation.  
   - **Red button** has the lowest average reward (0.0) but has been pressed the least (3 times). Exploring it could yield better results if its true mean is higher than observed.  

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, and the fact that we have limited time steps left, the **yellow button** is the best choice for now, as it maximizes the expected reward based on current data.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button**: Highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed 22 times. It seems like a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - **Yellow button**: Second-highest average reward (0.4615) and has been pressed 13 times. Also a good candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Green button**: Average reward (0.4545) and pressed 11 times. Slightly lower than yellow but still a decent option.  
   - **Red button**: Average reward (0.4286) and pressed 7 times. Less explored compared to blue, green, and yellow.  
   - **Purple button**: Lowest average reward (0.25) and pressed only 4 times. Least explored but has shown poor performance so far.  

2. **Decision**:  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, the **red button** has been pressed only 7 times, which is relatively fewer compared to the others. Exploring it further could reveal if it has a higher true mean reward than currently observed.  
   - The **purple button** has the lowest average reward but has been pressed the least. Exploring it could also be beneficial, but its poor performance so far makes it a less attractive choice.  

3. **Conclusion**:  
   Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, the **blue button** remains the best choice for maximizing immediate reward, while the **red button** is a good candidate for exploration. Since we are only 57 time steps in and have 43 remaining, we can afford to explore a bit more.  

However, to maximize the total reward in the short term, the **blue button** is the safest and most rewarding choice based on current data.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button**: Highest average reward (0.478) and has been pressed 23 times. It seems like a good candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Green button**: Average reward (0.455) is slightly lower than blue but has been pressed only 11 times, so it might still have potential.  
   - **Yellow button**: Average reward (0.462) is close to blue and has been pressed 13 times. It’s also a strong candidate.  
   - **Red button**: Average reward (0.429) is lower than blue and yellow, and it has been pressed 7 times. Less promising but still worth considering.  
   - **Purple button**: Lowest average reward (0.25) and has been pressed only 4 times. It’s the least explored but has shown poor performance so far.  

2. **Decision**:  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, making it the safest choice for exploitation.  
   - However, the **purple button** has been pressed the least and has a low average reward. Exploring it further could help confirm whether it’s truly a poor choice or if it has hidden potential.  

3. **Balancing Act**:  
   Given that we have 42 time steps remaining (100 - 58), we can afford to explore a bit more. However, since the purple button has shown the lowest performance so far, it’s less likely to yield a higher reward. The **blue button** remains the best choice for maximizing immediate reward.

The **purple button** has a low average reward (0.2) and has been pressed only 5 times, so it might be worth exploring to confirm if its low reward is consistent.

3. **Decision**: Given that we have only 35 time steps left (out of 100), we should prioritize exploitation to maximize rewards. The **blue button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be relatively confident in its performance. However, the **red button** also shows promise and has been pressed fewer times, so it’s worth exploring a bit more.

**Final Choice**: Since the **blue button** has the highest average reward and we’re closer to the end of the 100 time steps, we’ll prioritize exploitation over exploration.

2. **Exploration**: The **purple button** has been pressed the least (5 times) and has the lowest average reward (0.2). However, since it has been pressed so few times, there is a higher uncertainty about its true reward distribution. Exploring it further could potentially reveal a higher reward.

3. **Balancing Act**: Given that we have only 33 time steps left (100 - 67 = 33), we should prioritize exploitation to maximize our total reward. However, we should also consider exploring the **purple button** a bit more to reduce uncertainty, especially since it has been pressed so few times.

   - **Yellow**: 0.3889 (pressed 18 times)
   - **Purple**: 0.2 (pressed 5 times)

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:
   - **Red** has the highest average reward (0.4) but has been pressed only 10 times, which is relatively few compared to the others. This suggests that we might want to explore it more to confirm its high reward potential.
   - **Blue** has a slightly lower average reward (0.3929) but has been pressed 28 times, indicating that its reward distribution is likely well-understood.
   - **Purple** has the lowest average reward (0.2) and has been pressed only 5 times. It might be worth exploring further to see if its true reward is higher than currently observed.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given that **Red** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the least among the top performers, it is a strong candidate for the next press to gather more data and potentially maximize rewards.
   - **Purple**, despite its low average reward, has been pressed the least overall, so exploring it further could also be beneficial, but the potential upside of **Red** seems more promising at this stage.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue** has the highest average reward (0.3929) and has been pressed 28 times, giving us a relatively good estimate of its mean.  
   - **Green** and **Yellow** have similar average rewards (0.3846 and 0.3889, respectively) but fewer presses, so their estimates are less certain.  
   - **Red** has a slightly lower average reward (0.3636) and has been pressed 11 times.  
   - **Purple** has the lowest average reward (0.2) and has only been pressed 5 times, so its estimate is the least certain.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since **Purple** has been pressed the least and has the lowest average reward, it is the most uncertain. Exploring it further could reveal whether its true mean is higher than currently estimated, potentially leading to better rewards in the future.  

3. **Decision**:  
   Given the remaining 25 time steps, it’s worth exploring **Purple** to reduce uncertainty and potentially find a better option.

   - **Purple button**: Lowest average reward (0.166667) and pressed only 6 times. It seems less promising but could still be worth exploring.

2. **Decision**:  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, making it a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - However, the **green button** has a similar average reward but has been pressed fewer times, so exploring it further could yield better insights.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining time steps, we need to consider both the average rewards observed so far and the number of times each button has been pressed. This is a classic exploration-exploitation trade-off problem, where we need to balance between choosing buttons that have shown high rewards (exploitation) and trying buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information (exploration).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Average Rewards Analysis**:
   - **Yellow button**: Highest average reward (0.4583) with 24 presses.
   - **Green button**: Second highest average reward (0.3846) with 13 presses.
   - **Blue button**: Third highest average reward (0.3793) with 29 presses.
   - **Red button**: Fourth highest average reward (0.3636) with 11 presses.
   - **Purple button**: Lowest average reward (0.1667) with only 6 presses.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - The **yellow button** has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of presses, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - The **purple button** has been pressed the least and has a low average reward, but it might still be worth exploring to confirm its low reward.
   - The **green button** has a high average reward but fewer presses compared to the yellow button, so it’s also a good candidate.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given that we have only 17 time steps left (100 - 83), the focus should be more on exploitation rather than exploration, as we don’t have enough time to significantly improve our estimates of the buttons with fewer presses.
   - The **yellow button** has consistently shown the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be relatively confident in its performance.

Therefore, the best choice to maximize the total reward in the remaining time steps is to press the **yellow button**.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Current Average Rewards**:
   - **Blue**: 0.3793 (pressed 29 times)
   - **Green**: 0.3846 (pressed 13 times)

   - **Purple**: 0.1667 (pressed 6 times)

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:
   - **Yellow** has the highest average reward (0.44) and has been pressed a moderate number of times (25). It seems like a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Green** has a slightly lower average reward (0.3846) but has been pressed fewer times (13), suggesting it might still have potential for higher rewards.
   - **Purple** has the lowest average reward (0.1667) and has been pressed the least (6 times), indicating it might be worth exploring further to confirm its low reward.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given that **Yellow** has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of presses, it is a safe choice for exploitation.
   - However, **Green** and **Purple** could still yield higher rewards if explored further. Since we have 16 time steps left, we can afford to explore a bit more.

4. **Final Choice**:
   - To maximize the total reward, we should prioritize the button with the highest average reward that has been sufficiently explored. **Yellow** fits this criterion best.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 29 times with an average reward of 0.3793. This is a decent average, but we have more data on this button than others, so its estimate is likely more reliable.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 13 times with an average reward of 0.3846. This average is slightly higher than the blue button, but with fewer trials, the estimate might be less reliable.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 11 times with an average reward of 0.3636. This average is lower than both blue and green buttons, and the number of trials is also relatively low.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 40 times with an average reward of 0.525. This is the highest average reward among all buttons and is based on a substantial number of trials, making it a very reliable estimate.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 6 times with an average reward of 0.1667. This is the lowest average reward and is based on the fewest trials, so the estimate might be less reliable, but it’s still clearly underperforming compared to the others.

**Decision**: The yellow button has the highest average reward (0.525) and is based on a large number of trials (40), making it the most reliable and promising choice for maximizing the total reward.
