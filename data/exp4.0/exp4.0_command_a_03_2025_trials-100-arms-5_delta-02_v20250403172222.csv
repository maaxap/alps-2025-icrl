Given that all buttons have been pressed 0 times, we can start by arbitrarily choosing any button. A simple and fair approach is to select buttons in a round-robin fashion or randomly. Since no button has been pressed yet, we can start with any color.

Exploration involves trying out buttons we haven't pressed yet to gather more information about their reward distributions. Exploitation involves pressing buttons that have already shown promising rewards to maximize immediate gains.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Information**:  
   - **Blue**: Pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0.  
   - **Green**: Pressed 1 time, average reward 1.0.  
   - **Red, Yellow, Purple**: Not pressed yet, so their rewards are unknown.  

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Green** has the highest average reward so far (1.0), making it the best choice for exploitation.  
   - However, we have only pressed two buttons so far, and three buttons (Red, Yellow, Purple) remain unexplored. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.  

3. **Strategy for Early Stages**:  
   In the early stages of the game, it’s beneficial to explore more to gather information about the buttons. Since we’ve already pressed Blue and Green, the next logical step is to try one of the unexplored buttons.  

4. **Choosing the Next Button**:  
   Among Red, Yellow, and Purple, there’s no prior information to favor one over the others. We can choose any of them randomly or systematically. For simplicity, let’s choose **Red** as the next button to explore.

- **Exploration**: However, since we have only pressed the blue and purple buttons once, there is still a possibility that they might yield higher rewards. Exploring these buttons a bit more could provide valuable information.

**Decision**:
Given that the red button has consistently provided the highest rewards, and we still have a significant number of time steps left (90 out of 100), it is reasonable to continue exploiting the red button while also keeping an eye on the less explored buttons.

1. **Red Button**: Pressed 5 times with an average reward of 0.6. This is the highest average reward among all buttons, but it has been pressed the most, so we might be overestimating its true mean.

2. **Green and Yellow Buttons**: Both have been pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. These buttons have shown potential but need more exploration to confirm their true means.

3. **Blue and Purple Buttons**: Both have been pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have the least information, and their true means are highly uncertain.

**Strategy**:  
- **Exploitation**: Choose the button with the highest known average reward (red) to maximize immediate reward.  
- **Exploration**: Choose a less-explored button (blue, purple, green, or yellow) to gather more information and potentially discover a better option.

Given that we have 89 time steps remaining, it’s still early in the game, and exploration is crucial. However, the red button has shown the most promise so far, and exploiting it could yield higher rewards in the short term.

**Decision**:  
To balance exploitation and exploration, we’ll choose the **red button** again, as it has the highest average reward and further exploration of it could confirm its superiority.

3. **Exploration**:  
   The **Blue** button has been pressed only 2 times and has an average reward of 0.0. However, this is based on very limited data, and it’s possible that its true mean reward is higher. It’s worth exploring further to confirm or refute this.

4. **Decision**:  
   Since **Green**, **Yellow**, and **Purple** all have the same average reward (0.5) and have been pressed equally (2 times), there’s no strong reason to prefer one over the others based on current data. **Red** has been over-explored relative to its reward, so it’s less attractive. **Blue** is the least explored and has the lowest average reward, but it’s worth investigating further to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option.

   - Since Green and Red buttons have the highest average rewards and similar exploration levels, we should prioritize one of them for exploitation.  
   - However, to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially higher rewards from less explored buttons, we should also consider exploring Yellow or Purple.  

4. **Final Choice**:  
   Given the current data, **Green** has the highest average reward and has been pressed fewer times than Red. Therefore, it’s a good choice to exploit its potential while still leaving room for exploration in later steps.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Green button** has the highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed 8 times, which is a decent number of trials to trust its average.  
   - **Red button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.428571) but has been pressed 7 times, so its estimate is also relatively reliable.  
   - **Blue button** has a lower average reward (0.25) and has been pressed 4 times, so it seems less promising.  
   - **Yellow** and **Purple buttons** have the same average reward (0.3333) but have only been pressed 3 times each, so there’s more uncertainty about their true rewards.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since **Yellow** and **Purple** have been pressed the least, they are the most uncertain. Exploring them further could reveal higher rewards than currently estimated.  

3. **Choosing the Best Option**:  
   - **Green** is the best-known option, but exploring **Yellow** or **Purple** could yield better long-term results.  
   - Between **Yellow** and **Purple**, since they have the same average reward and number of presses, we can choose either.

   - **Red button**: Second-highest average reward (0.428571) over 7 presses.

   - The **red button** is also a good option, but its average reward is slightly lower than green.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Red button**: Average reward of 0.42857 (pressed 7 times)
   - **Green button**: Average reward of 0.4 (pressed 10 times)
   - **Purple button**: Average reward of 0.4 (pressed 5 times)

2. **Exploration**: The buttons that have been pressed fewer times and could still have higher rewards are:
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of 0.25 (pressed 4 times)
   - **Yellow button**: Average reward of 0.25 (pressed 4 times)

3. **Decision**:
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward so far, but it has been pressed 7 times, which is a decent number of trials.
   - The **green button** and **purple button** have the next highest rewards, but green has been pressed more than purple.
   - The **blue** and **yellow buttons** have low average rewards but have been pressed the least, so they could still have higher true rewards.

4. **Trade-off**: Since we have 70 time steps left, we can afford to explore a bit more. However, the **red button** has shown the best performance so far, and we should prioritize exploitation to maximize rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Option (Exploitation):**  
   The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.4444) among all buttons, based on 9 presses. This suggests it might be the best choice so far.

2. **Exploration Consideration:**  
   The **blue** and **yellow** buttons have been pressed only 4 times each, which is fewer than the others. Their average reward (0.25) is lower, but with so few presses, there’s a chance their true reward could be higher. Exploring these buttons could reveal better options.

3. **Balancing Exploitation and Exploration:**  
   Since we have 68 remaining time steps (out of 100), we can afford to explore a bit more. However, the red button’s high average reward and relatively moderate number of presses (9) make it a strong candidate for exploitation.

4. **Decision:**  
   Given the red button’s high average reward and the need to maximize total reward, it’s the best choice for now. Exploration can be done later if needed.

   - Blue and Yellow buttons have been pressed fewer times, so there’s more uncertainty about their true reward distributions. However, their current average rewards are significantly lower than purple, green, and red.  
   - Given that we have only 60 time steps left, it’s riskier to explore buttons with low observed rewards.

3. **Decision**:  
   - The **purple button** has consistently shown the highest reward and has been pressed enough times to suggest it’s a reliable choice.  
   - While exploration is important, the remaining time steps are limited, and the purple button offers the best chance of maximizing the total reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The purple button has the highest average reward (0.6923) and has been pressed 13 times. This suggests it might be the best option to exploit.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While purple seems the best, we should also consider exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options. The blue and yellow buttons have been pressed only 4 times each, which is relatively low compared to the others.

3. **Risk of Over-Exploration**: Given that we only have 100 time steps, spending too much time exploring buttons with low average rewards might not be optimal. The green and red buttons have been pressed 10 times each and have the same average reward (0.4), which is lower than purple but still decent.

4. **Decision**: Since purple has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation. However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potential higher rewards from less-pressed buttons, we should also consider pressing blue or yellow occasionally.

Given the current data, the **purple button** remains the best choice for exploitation, as it has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to give us confidence in its performance.

3. **Decision**:

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To make the best choice, we need to balance between **exploitation** (choosing the button with the highest known average reward) and **exploration** (trying buttons with fewer presses to gather more information about their potential rewards).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **purple button** has the highest average reward (0.6) and has been pressed 20 times. This suggests it is a strong candidate for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: The **yellow button** has the lowest average reward (0.2) but has only been pressed 5 times. It might have a higher true mean reward than observed so far, and exploring it further could be beneficial.

3. **Other Buttons**:
   - **Red button**: High average reward (0.4) but pressed 10 times. It’s a good candidate but not as unexplored as yellow.
   - **Green button**: Moderate average reward (0.36) and pressed 11 times. It’s a decent option but not as promising as purple or red.
   - **Blue button**: Low average reward (0.25) and pressed 4 times. It’s less promising than other options.

4. **Decision**: Given that we have 50 time steps left, we should prioritize **exploitation** to maximize total reward. The **purple button** has the highest average reward and sufficient data to support its choice.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The **purple button** has the highest average reward (0.5714) and has been pressed 21 times. It seems like a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Other High Performers**: The **red button** has a high average reward (0.4) but has only been pressed 10 times. It might be worth exploring further to confirm its potential.

3. **Under-Explored Buttons**: The **blue button** (pressed 4 times) and **yellow button** (pressed 5 times) have been pressed fewer times and might still have untapped potential. However, their average rewards (0.25 and 0.2) are lower than the purple and red buttons.

4. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Since we have 49 time steps remaining, we can afford to explore a bit more while still exploiting the best-known options. However, given the high reward of the purple button and the limited time, it’s safer to exploit it for now.

**Final Decision**: The **purple button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be a reliable choice. We’ll exploit it to maximize immediate rewards.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons that have shown high average rewards so far and exploring the buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information about their potential rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Average Rewards**:
   - **Blue**: 0.25 (pressed 4 times)
   - **Green**: 0.3636 (pressed 11 times)
   - **Red**: 0.3636 (pressed 11 times)
   - **Yellow**: 0.2 (pressed 5 times)
   - **Purple**: 0.5357 (pressed 28 times)

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:
   - **Purple** has the highest average reward (0.5357) and has been pressed the most (28 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice for exploitation.
   - **Green** and **Red** have similar average rewards (0.3636) but have been pressed fewer times (11 each), suggesting they might still have potential for higher rewards.
   - **Blue** and **Yellow** have lower average rewards (0.25 and 0.2) and have been pressed fewer times (4 and 5), making them candidates for exploration.

3. **Decision**:
   - **Purple** is the safest choice for exploitation, given its high average reward and the number of times it has been pressed.
   - However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially higher rewards from other buttons, we should also consider exploring **Green** or **Red** since they have been pressed fewer times and have decent average rewards.

4. **Final Choice**:
   Given the high average reward of **Purple** and the need to maximize immediate rewards, we’ll choose **Purple** for this step.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The purple button has the highest average reward (0.6216) and has been pressed the most (37 times). This suggests it is a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While purple seems the best, we should also consider exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options. The blue, yellow, and green/red buttons have been pressed fewer times and could have higher true means than currently observed.

3. **Prioritizing Exploration**: Given that we have 32 time steps left (100 - 68 = 32), we can afford to explore a bit more. The yellow button has the lowest average reward (0.2) but has only been pressed 5 times, which is the least among all buttons. This makes it a good candidate for exploration to see if its true mean is higher than currently observed.

4. **Decision**: While purple is the safest choice for exploitation, exploring the yellow button could yield valuable information and potentially higher rewards if its true mean is higher than 0.2.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The **purple button** has the highest average reward (0.6216) and has been pressed 37 times. It’s the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration Needs**: The **blue button** has only been pressed 4 times, which is the least among all buttons. Its average reward (0.25) is not impressive, but it hasn’t been explored enough to rule it out completely. Exploring it further could reveal higher potential.

3. **Other Buttons**:
   - **Green** and **red** buttons have similar average rewards (0.3636) and have been pressed 11 times each. They are decent but not as promising as purple.
   - **Yellow** button has a low average reward (0.1667) and has been pressed 6 times. It’s unlikely to be a better choice than purple.

4. **Strategy at This Stage**: With 31 time steps remaining (100 - 69 = 31), we should prioritize **exploitation** of the purple button while occasionally exploring the least-pressed buttons (like blue) to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option.

**Decision**: Given the high reward of the purple button and the need to maximize total reward, we’ll stick with it for now. However, in the next few steps, we should consider exploring the blue button to gather more data.

Given the need to maximize total reward and the limited time steps remaining, the best strategy is to continue exploiting the purple button while occasionally exploring others. For this step, we’ll prioritize exploitation for maximum reward.

1. **Current Average Rewards:**
   - **Blue:** 0.25 (pressed 4 times)
   - **Green:** 0.3636 (pressed 11 times)
   - **Red:** 0.3636 (pressed 11 times)

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration:**
   - **Purple** has the highest average reward (0.6304) and has been pressed the most (46 times), indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Blue** and **Yellow** have been pressed fewer times and have lower average rewards, suggesting they might be worth exploring further.
   - **Green** and **Red** have similar average rewards and have been pressed a moderate number of times, but they are not as promising as **Purple**.

3. **Remaining Time Steps:**
   - We have 22 time steps left (100 - 78 = 22). Given the limited time, focusing on the button with the highest known reward is a reasonable strategy, unless there’s a strong reason to explore further.

4. **Decision:**
   - **Purple** has consistently shown the highest reward and has been pressed enough times to be relatively confident in its performance.
   - Exploring **Blue** or **Yellow** might yield higher rewards, but the risk is higher, and we have limited time left.

Given the information and the goal to maximize total reward, the best choice is to exploit the button with the highest known reward.

1. **Current Best Option (Exploitation):**  
   The **purple button** has the highest average reward (0.625) and has been pressed the most (48 times). This suggests it is a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration Opportunities:**  
   - The **blue button** has only been pressed 4 times, with an average reward of 0.25. This is a low sample size, so its true reward potential is still uncertain.  
   - The **yellow button** has been pressed 6 times, with an average reward of 0.1666. This is also a low sample size, but its average reward is lower than the others.  
   - The **green** and **red buttons** have been pressed 11 times each, with identical average rewards of 0.3636. These are moderately explored but could still have higher true rewards.

3. **Trade-off Analysis:**  
   - **Purple** is the safest choice for immediate reward but offers no new information.  
   - **Blue** and **yellow** are under-explored and could have higher true rewards than their current averages suggest.  
   - **Green** and **red** are moderately explored but could still be better than their current averages.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 4 time steps, we need to consider both the estimated reward of each button and the uncertainty in those estimates. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Estimates**:  
   - **Purple**: Highest average reward (0.5806) with 62 samples, suggesting a reliable estimate.  
   - **Green and Red**: Similar average rewards (0.3636) with 11 samples each, indicating moderate reliability.  
   - **Blue**: Average reward (0.3333) with 6 samples, less reliable than purple but better than yellow.  
   - **Yellow**: Lowest average reward (0.1667) with 6 samples, least promising.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - With only 4 time steps left, **exploitation** is more critical than exploration.  
   - Purple has the highest reward and a large sample size, making it the safest choice for maximizing immediate rewards.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Purple is the best option based on its high average reward and reliable estimate.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 3 time steps, we need to consider both the estimated reward of each button and the uncertainty around those estimates. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Estimates**:  
   - **Purple** has the highest average reward (0.5714) but has been pressed 63 times, so its estimate is likely reliable.  
   - **Green** and **Red** have similar average rewards (0.3636) but have been pressed only 11 times each, so there’s more uncertainty.  
   - **Blue** has an average reward of 0.3333 but has been pressed only 6 times, so there’s higher uncertainty.  
   - **Yellow** has the lowest average reward (0.1667) and has been pressed 6 times, so its estimate is likely reliable.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - With only 3 time steps left, **exploitation** (choosing the button with the highest estimated reward) is more critical than exploration.  
   - **Purple** has the highest estimated reward and a relatively reliable estimate due to being pressed 63 times.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Purple** is the best choice to maximize the total reward in the remaining steps.
