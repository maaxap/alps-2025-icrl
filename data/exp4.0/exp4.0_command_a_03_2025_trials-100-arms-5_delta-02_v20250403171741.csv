Exploration involves trying out buttons with unknown or uncertain rewards to gather more information, while exploitation involves choosing buttons that have already shown promising rewards.

1. **Current Observations**:  
   - Blue, green, and red buttons have been pressed once each, all yielding a reward of 1.0.  
   - Yellow button has been pressed once, yielding a reward of 0.0.

   - Yellow button has shown a low reward (0.0), but it’s also based on only one data point.  
   - Purple button is completely unexplored, so we have no information about its reward distribution.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since blue, green, and red buttons have the same observed reward (1.0), choosing any of them would be exploiting the current best-known option.  
   - However, we also need to explore the purple button to understand its potential reward, as it could be higher than the others.  
   - Given that we have only 100 time steps, it’s crucial to explore early to gather more information.

1. **Red Button**: Pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.75. This is the highest average reward among all buttons, and it has been pressed the most, giving us more confidence in its performance.

2. **Blue Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is a moderate reward, but we have less data compared to the red button.

3. **Green Button**: Also pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5, similar to the blue button.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.0. This button has not yielded any rewards so far.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed only 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. We have very little data on this button.

Given the information, the **red button** has the highest average reward and the most data points, making it the most promising choice to maximize the total reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.8) and has been pressed 5 times, which is a decent sample size. It seems like the best choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: The **purple button** has only been pressed once and has an average reward of 0.0. However, this is based on very little data, so it could still be a good button. Similarly, the **yellow button** has an average reward of 0.0 after 2 presses, but it’s worth exploring further since it hasn’t been pressed much.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we have 88 time steps left, we can afford to explore a bit more. However, the **red button** is clearly performing well, and pressing it again is likely to yield a good reward. Exploring the **purple** or **yellow** buttons could be risky given their low average rewards so far.

4. **Decision**: Given the high reward of the **red button** and the limited information about the other buttons, the safest and most rewarding choice is to press the **red button** again.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - **Red** has the highest average reward (0.833) and has been pressed the most (6 times), suggesting it might be the best option so far.
   - **Yellow** and **Purple** have low average rewards (0.0), but they have been pressed fewer times, so their true means might still be uncertain.
   - **Blue** and **Green** have moderate average rewards (0.5) but have been pressed only twice, so there's still uncertainty about their true means.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - **Exploitation**: Based on current data, **Red** seems the best choice to maximize immediate reward.
   - **Exploration**: **Yellow** and **Purple** have been pressed the least, so exploring them could reveal higher rewards if their true means are underestimated.

4. **Decision**:
   - Since **Red** has the highest average reward and has been pressed sufficiently to give us confidence in its performance, it’s the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.
   - However, exploring **Yellow** or **Purple** could be beneficial if their true means are higher than currently observed. Given the limited data for these buttons, it’s worth considering exploring one of them.

   - **Red button** has the highest average reward (0.714) over 7 presses, making it the most promising so far.  
   - **Blue and Green buttons** have the same average reward (0.5) but with fewer presses (2 each), so their true potential is less certain.

   - However, **Yellow and Purple buttons** have been under-explored. Given their low sample sizes, there’s a chance they could yield higher rewards if tested more.  
   - **Blue and Green buttons** are moderately explored but could still be worth revisiting to confirm their potential.

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since the goal is to maximize total reward over 100 time steps, it’s important to balance exploitation (choosing the best-known option) with exploration (testing under-explored options).  
   - Given that **Red** is the current best performer and has been tested more than the others, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Observations**:
   - **Red button**: Pressed 12 times, average reward 0.5833. This is the highest average reward so far, indicating it might be the best button.
   - **Blue and Green buttons**: Both pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.3333. These are lower than the red button but could still be worth exploring further.
   - **Yellow button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.0. This seems unpromising but needs more exploration to confirm.
   - **Purple button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. This also needs more exploration.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - The **yellow and purple buttons** have been pressed very few times and have shown no reward, so they are candidates for exploration.
   - The **blue and green buttons** have moderate exploration but lower rewards than the red button.

3. **Decision**:
   - Since the **red button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough to give us confidence in its performance, it’s a good choice for exploitation.
   - However, we should also consider exploring the **yellow and purple buttons** to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options. Given that we have 79 time steps left, we can afford to explore a bit more.

4. **Final Choice**:
   - To balance exploration and exploitation, we’ll press the **red button** again to maximize immediate reward while continuing to gather data on the other buttons in future steps.

1. **Current Performance**:  
   - **Red button** has the highest average reward (0.45) and has been pressed the most (20 times), indicating it’s the most reliable choice so far.  
   - **Blue** and **Green buttons** have the same average reward (0.3333), but they’ve been pressed only 3 times each, so their true means are less certain.  
   - **Yellow** and **Purple buttons** have an average reward of 0.0, but they’ve been pressed only 2 times each, so their true means could still be higher.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - We’ve already explored the **Yellow** and **Purple buttons** a bit, but their low rewards suggest they might not be worth further exploration unless we’re very uncertain about their true means.  
   - The **Blue** and **Green buttons** have moderate rewards but haven’t been explored much. Exploring them further could reveal if they’re better than the **Red button**.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since the **Red button** has the highest reward so far and has been tested extensively, it’s the safest choice for exploitation.  
   - However, to balance exploration and exploitation, we should occasionally test the **Blue** or **Green buttons** to confirm their true means.  

Given that we’re only 30 time steps in (out of 100), it’s still worth exploring the **Blue** or **Green buttons** to gather more data. Let’s choose the **Blue button** this time to reduce uncertainty about its true mean.

   - **Blue button** has a lower average reward (0.25) and has been pressed 4 times.  
   - **Yellow and Purple buttons** have both been pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.0, but this could be due to low sample size.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - **Red button** is the safest choice for exploitation (maximizing immediate reward) based on current data.  
   - **Yellow and Purple buttons** have not been explored much, so there’s a chance they could yield higher rewards. However, their current average is 0.0, which is risky.  
   - **Green button** could be worth exploring further since it has a decent average reward but limited data.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.476) and has been pressed the most (21 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice for exploitation.  
   - The **green button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.333) but has been pressed only 3 times, suggesting it might be worth exploring further.  
   - The **blue button** has a lower average reward (0.25) and has been pressed 4 times, making it less attractive than red or green.  
   - The **yellow** and **purple buttons** have both been pressed only 2 times and have an average reward of 0.0, which is concerning. However, they have been explored very little, so they could still have higher rewards.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   - Since we have 68 remaining time steps, we can afford to explore buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more data.  
   - The **yellow** and **purple buttons** are the least explored, and their average rewards are currently 0.0. However, given their extremely low exploration, it’s worth pressing one of them to see if they might yield higher rewards.  

3. **Final Decision**:  
   - Between **yellow** and **purple**, both are equally unexplored, so we can choose one arbitrarily. Let’s choose **yellow** for this step.

2. **Exploration**: The purple button has been pressed only 2 times and has an average reward of 0.0. This is the least explored button, and its average reward might be misleading due to the small sample size. It could potentially have a higher mean reward that we haven't discovered yet.

1. **Current Best Performer**: The red button has the highest average reward of 0.4583, based on 24 presses. This suggests it might be the most reliable choice so far.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the red button seems the best, we've pressed it 24 times, which is significantly more than the others. The other buttons, especially green and purple, have fewer presses and might have higher potential rewards that we haven't fully explored yet.

3. **Potential for Higher Rewards**: The green button has an average reward of 0.4, which is close to the red button's average, but with only 5 presses, there's a higher uncertainty and potential for it to be better. The purple button, with an average of 0.3333 and only 3 presses, also has potential but is slightly lower than green.

4. **Least Explored Options**: The blue and yellow buttons have the same average reward of 0.25, but they have been pressed only 4 times each. There's a chance they could perform better with more exploration.

Given the goal is to maximize total reward, we should balance exploitation of the best-known option (red) with exploration of less-known options that could potentially yield higher rewards. Since green has shown promise and has been pressed fewer times compared to red, it's a good candidate for exploration.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performers**:  
   - **Green button** has the highest average reward (0.5) but has only been pressed 6 times.  
   - **Red button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.4583) but has been pressed 24 times, so its reward estimate is more reliable.  

2. **Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - **Blue** and **Yellow** buttons have been pressed only 4 times each, with the same average reward (0.25). They could potentially have higher rewards but need more exploration.  
   - **Purple** button has been pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.3333, which is also under-explored.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we’re only 41 time steps in (out of 100), there’s still room for exploration.  
   - The **green button** has the highest average reward but hasn’t been pressed much, so it’s worth pressing again to confirm its potential.  
   - The **blue**, **yellow**, and **purple** buttons are also worth exploring, but the green button has shown the most promise so far.  

Given this analysis, the best choice is to press the **green button** again to gather more data and potentially maximize rewards.

   - However, to balance exploration and exploitation, we could consider pressing the blue or green buttons to gather more data, as they have been pressed fewer times and might have higher true means.  

Given the goal is to maximize total reward over 100 time steps, and with only 51 steps remaining, it’s more critical to exploit the best-known option rather than explore further.

1. **Current Averages**:  
   - **Red**: 0.5556 (highest average, but pressed 36 times)  
   - **Blue**: 0.4 (pressed 5 times)  
   - **Green**: 0.4 (pressed 10 times)  
   - **Yellow**: 0.25 (pressed 4 times)  
   - **Purple**: 0.25 (pressed 4 times)  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - **Red** has the highest average reward but has been pressed the most, so its estimate is likely reliable.  
   - **Blue** and **Green** have moderate averages but fewer trials, so their true means could be higher or lower.  
   - **Yellow** and **Purple** have low averages but very few trials, so their true means could be higher.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since **Red** is the most reliable choice for high rewards, it’s a safe exploitation option.  
   - However, **Yellow** and **Purple** have been under-explored, and their low averages could be due to insufficient sampling. Exploring them could reveal higher rewards.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the goal is to maximize total reward, **Red** is the safest choice for immediate reward.  
   - However, exploring **Yellow** or **Purple** could lead to discovering a better option in the long run.  

Since we have 41 time steps left, balancing exploration and exploitation is key. Let’s explore **Yellow** or **Purple** to gather more data.

2. **Observation**:
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.5556) and has been pressed the most (36 times), indicating it's a reliable choice.
   - The **purple button** has the lowest average reward (0.25) and has been pressed the least (4 times), suggesting it might not be a good choice.
   - The **blue**, **green**, and **yellow** buttons have similar average rewards (0.4) but fewer presses, leaving room for exploration.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Since the **red button** has consistently performed well, it’s a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.

   - **Blue** has a decent average reward but has been pressed fewer times, suggesting it might be worth exploring further.
   - **Green** and **Yellow** have the same average reward but **Yellow** has been pressed fewer times, making it a candidate for exploration.
   - **Purple** has the lowest average reward and has been pressed the least, but it’s still worth exploring to confirm its low reward.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Since we have only 32 time steps left (100 - 68 = 32), we should focus more on exploiting the best-known options while still exploring the less-pressed buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better rewards.

4. **Decision**:
   - **Red** is the most reliable choice for exploitation, given its high average reward and the number of times it has been pressed.
   - However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially higher rewards from **Blue** or **Yellow**, we should allocate some trials to these buttons.

Given the current information and the need to balance exploitation and exploration, the best choice for the next step is to press the **Red** button, as it has the highest average reward and has been sufficiently explored to be a reliable choice.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Current Average Rewards:**
   - **Blue:** 0.4286 (pressed 7 times)
   - **Green:** 0.4 (pressed 10 times)
   - **Red:** 0.5116 (pressed 43 times)
   - **Yellow:** 0.4 (pressed 5 times)
   - **Purple:** 0.25 (pressed 4 times)

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration:**
   - **Red** has the highest average reward (0.5116) and has been pressed the most (43 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice for exploitation.
   - **Blue** has a slightly lower average reward (0.4286) but has been pressed fewer times (7 times), suggesting it might still have potential.
   - **Yellow** and **Green** have the same average reward (0.4), but **Yellow** has been pressed fewer times (5 times), making it a candidate for exploration.
   - **Purple** has the lowest average reward (0.25) and has been pressed only 4 times, but it’s worth exploring further to confirm its low reward.

3. **Decision:**
   - **Red** is the safest choice for exploitation, given its high average reward and extensive testing.
   - **Yellow** and **Purple** are good candidates for exploration since they have been pressed fewer times and could potentially yield higher rewards than currently observed.

Given that we still have 31 time steps left (100 - 69 = 31), it’s a good strategy to continue exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times while also exploiting the best-known option.

**Final Decision:**
To balance exploitation and exploration, I will choose the **Red** button for its proven high reward, but I will also consider exploring **Yellow** or **Purple** in subsequent steps if their potential rewards seem promising.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Red button** has the highest average reward (0.5227) and has been pressed the most (44 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice.

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we have 30 time steps left, we should focus on exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times but show some potential. The **blue button** and **yellow button** are good candidates for exploration because they have been pressed fewer times and have reasonable average rewards.

3. **Final Decision**:

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.54) and has been pressed the most (50 times). This suggests it’s a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: The **yellow button** has a high average reward (0.5) but has only been pressed 6 times. This means we have less certainty about its true reward distribution, and it could potentially be even better than the red button.

3. **Remaining Buttons**: The **blue**, **green**, and **purple** buttons have lower average rewards and fewer presses, making them less attractive for both exploitation and exploration.

4. **Decision**: Given that we have only 22 time steps left (100 - 78 = 22), we should prioritize **exploitation** to maximize total reward. However, it’s also worth exploring the **yellow button** a bit more to confirm its potential.

**Final Decision**: Since the **red button** has the highest known reward and we’re running out of time, it’s the safest choice to maximize total reward.

   - Green: 0.4  
   - Red: 0.5614  
   - Yellow: 0.5  
   - Purple: 0.25  

2. **Number of Trials**:  
   - Red has been pressed the most (57 times), indicating a higher confidence in its average reward.  
   - Purple has been pressed the least (4 times), so its average reward is less reliable.  

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - Red has the highest average reward (0.5614) and a large number of trials, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - Yellow has a high average reward (0.5) but fewer trials (8), so it could be worth exploring further.  
   - Blue, Green, and Purple have lower average rewards and are less promising.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Given the remaining 13 time steps, it’s best to focus on the button with the highest expected reward, which is **Red**. Exploring Yellow further could be risky due to the limited time left.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The red button has the highest average reward (0.5689655172413793) and has been pressed the most (58 times). This suggests it is a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the red button seems the best, we should also consider exploring other buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options. The yellow button has a high average reward (0.5) but has only been pressed 8 times, which is fewer than the red button. The green button also has a decent average reward (0.4) and has been pressed 10 times.

3. **Least Explored Buttons**: The blue and purple buttons have been pressed the least (8 and 4 times, respectively) and have lower average rewards (0.375 and 0.25, respectively). However, their low number of presses means we have less confidence in their true reward potential.

Given that we only have 12 time steps left (100 - 88 = 12), we should focus more on exploitation rather than exploration, as we don’t have enough time to gather significant new information about the less-pressed buttons.

**Decision**: The red button has consistently provided the highest rewards and has been pressed enough times to give us confidence in its performance. Therefore, the best choice to maximize the total reward in the remaining time steps is to press the red button.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Current Average Rewards:**
   - **Red button:** 0.559 (highest average reward, pressed 59 times)
   - **Yellow button:** 0.5 (second-highest average reward, pressed 8 times)
   - **Green button:** 0.4 (pressed 10 times)
   - **Blue button:** 0.375 (pressed 8 times)
   - **Purple button:** 0.25 (lowest average reward, pressed 4 times)

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration:**
   - **Red button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, so it’s a safe choice for exploitation.
   - **Yellow button** has a high average reward but has been pressed fewer times, so it could be a good candidate for further exploration.
   - **Purple button** has the lowest average reward and has been pressed the least, so it might be worth exploring to confirm if it’s truly the worst option.

3. **Remaining Time Steps:**
   - We have 11 time steps left (100 - 89 = 11). Given the limited time, focusing on buttons with higher average rewards is more critical.

4. **Decision:**
   - **Red button** is the most reliable choice based on current data, as it has the highest average reward and has been sufficiently explored.
   - **Yellow button** is also a strong contender, but with fewer presses, its average reward might still change significantly.

Given the limited time and the goal to maximize total reward, the **Red button** is the best choice for exploitation.

2. **Number of Trials**:  
   - Red has the most trials (60), which gives us confidence in its average reward.  
   - Yellow and Blue have fewer trials (8 each), so their averages might not be as reliable.  
   - Green has 10 trials, which is moderate.  
   - Purple has the fewest trials (4), so its average is the least reliable.  

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons that have given the highest average rewards so far and exploring the buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information about their potential rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.5606) and has been pressed the most (66 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice.  
   - The **yellow button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.5556) but has been pressed only 9 times, suggesting it might have more potential if explored further.  
   - The **blue** and **green** buttons have lower average rewards (0.375 and 0.4, respectively) and have been pressed a moderate number of times (8 and 10), so they are less promising.  
   - The **purple button** has the lowest average reward (0.25) and has been pressed only 4 times, but it’s worth exploring further since it’s been pressed the least.

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - With only 3 time steps left (97 out of 100), the focus should be on **exploitation** rather than exploration, as there’s limited time to gather more information.  
   - The **red button** is the safest choice given its high average reward and consistent performance.

3. **Final Decision**:  
   Given the limited time and the need to maximize rewards, the **red button** is the best choice.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Red Button**: It has been pressed 67 times with an average reward of 0.567. This is the highest average reward among all buttons, and the large number of presses gives us confidence in this estimate. It’s a strong candidate.

2. **Yellow Button**: It has been pressed 9 times with an average reward of 0.556. While the average reward is slightly lower than the red button, the smaller number of presses means there’s more uncertainty. It could potentially have a higher true mean reward.

3. **Green Button**: It has been pressed 10 times with an average reward of 0.4. This is lower than both the red and yellow buttons, so it’s less attractive.

4. **Blue Button**: It has been pressed 8 times with an average reward of 0.375. This is even lower than the green button, making it a less appealing choice.

5. **Purple Button**: It has been pressed only 4 times with an average reward of 0.25. This is the lowest average reward, and the small number of presses doesn’t provide much confidence in this estimate.

Given that we only have 2 time steps left, the best strategy is to focus on the button with the highest known average reward, which is the **red button**. While the yellow button has potential due to higher uncertainty, the red button’s higher average reward and more reliable estimate make it the safer and more rewarding choice.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the average rewards**:  
   - Red button: 0.5735 (highest average reward, pressed 68 times)  
   - Yellow button: 0.5556 (second-highest average reward, pressed 9 times)  
   - Green button: 0.4 (pressed 10 times)  
   - Blue button: 0.375 (pressed 8 times)  
   - Purple button: 0.25 (pressed 4 times)  

2. **Consider uncertainty**:  
   - The red button has been pressed the most (68 times), so its average reward is likely a good estimate of its true mean.  
   - The yellow button has a high average reward but has been pressed only 9 times, so there is more uncertainty about its true mean.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since the red button has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to reduce uncertainty, it is the safest and most rewarding choice for the final step.
