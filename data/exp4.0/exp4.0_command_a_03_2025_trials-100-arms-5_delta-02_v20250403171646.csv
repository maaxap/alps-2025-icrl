Given that all buttons have been pressed 0 times, we can start by arbitrarily choosing any button. A simple and fair approach is to select buttons in a round-robin fashion or randomly. For simplicity, let's start with the **blue** button.

Exploration involves trying out buttons with unknown rewards to gather more information, while exploitation involves choosing buttons that have already shown promising rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Information**:  
   - **Blue button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 1.0.  
   - **Green button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0.  
   - **Red, Yellow, Purple buttons**: Not pressed yet, so their rewards are unknown.  

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **blue button** has shown the highest reward so far, so exploiting it seems promising.  
   - However, we have only pressed two buttons out of five, and three buttons remain unexplored. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.  

3. **Strategy for Early Stages**:  
   - In the early stages (like now, at step 3 out of 100), exploration is crucial to gather more information about the buttons.  
   - Since the **red, yellow, and purple buttons** have not been pressed yet, we should prioritize exploring one of them.  

4. **Choosing the Next Button**:

However, it's also important to explore the other buttons to gather more information, especially since we have 100 time steps. A balanced approach would be to continue exploiting the blue button while also exploring the untested buttons (yellow and purple) to understand their reward distributions.

Given that we've only pressed three buttons so far, and the blue button has shown the best result, it makes sense to press the blue button again to confirm its potential. However, to ensure we don't miss out on potentially better options, we should also start exploring the untested buttons soon.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. Similar to the green button, it hasn't shown any reward yet, but we need more data.

Given that we are early in the 100 time steps (only 10 steps completed), it’s a good strategy to explore a bit more. **Red** and **Purple** both have only 1 press, so let’s explore one of them.

Since the purple button has been pressed the least and has shown a lower reward so far, it might be beneficial to explore it further to gather more data and confirm if its true mean is indeed lower than the others. However, since all other buttons have the same average reward and have been pressed more, it’s also important to continue exploring them to refine their estimates.

Given the exploration-exploitation trade-off, a balanced approach would be to continue exploring the buttons with fewer presses or those with uncertain estimates. Since purple has the least data and the lowest observed reward, it’s a candidate for exploration. However, since all other buttons have the same average reward and more data, it’s reasonable to continue exploring one of them to confirm their potential.

However, to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, it’s important to explore further to identify which button might have a higher true mean reward. Since all buttons have been explored equally (except yellow, which has been pressed 4 times), the next logical step is to continue exploring the buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more data.

Given that blue, green, red, and purple have all been pressed only twice, and yellow has been pressed four times, the best choice would be to press one of the less explored buttons to reduce uncertainty about their true mean rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Performance Analysis**:
   - **Blue**: Pressed 3 times, average reward 0.3333.
   - **Green**: Pressed 2 times, average reward 0.5.
   - **Red**: Pressed 2 times, average reward 0.5.
   - **Yellow**: Pressed 4 times, average reward 0.5.
   - **Purple**: Pressed 2 times, average reward 0.5.

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:
   - **Exploitation**: The green, red, yellow, and purple buttons all have a higher average reward (0.5) compared to the blue button (0.3333). Among these, yellow has been pressed the most (4 times), which gives us more confidence in its average reward.
   - **Exploration**: The blue button has been pressed only 3 times, and its average reward is lower. However, it has been pressed fewer times compared to yellow, so there is still some uncertainty about its true mean reward.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given that the green, red, and purple buttons have been pressed only 2 times each, they still have potential for higher rewards and need more exploration. However, since their average rewards are the same (0.5), we can choose any of them for exploration.
   - The yellow button, with an average reward of 0.5 and the most presses (4 times), is a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - The blue button, with the lowest average reward and fewer presses, is less attractive for exploitation but could be considered for further exploration.

4. **Final Choice**:
   - To balance exploitation and exploration, we can choose a button that has shown good performance but has been pressed fewer times. In this case, **green**, **red**, or **purple** are good candidates for exploration since they have been pressed only 2 times each and have an average reward of 0.5.

Given the need to explore buttons with fewer presses and good potential, I will choose the **green** button next.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Observations**:  
   - **Yellow button** has the highest average reward (0.5555) with 9 samples.  
   - All other buttons (blue, green, red, purple) have the same average reward (0.3333) but with only 3 samples each.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The yellow button has a higher average reward and more samples, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, the other buttons have fewer samples, so their true reward distributions are less certain. We should explore them further to ensure we’re not missing a better option.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since the yellow button has already been sampled 9 times and shows a higher reward, it’s a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - However, to ensure we’re not overlooking a potentially better button, we should explore one of the under-sampled buttons (blue, green, red, or purple).  

4. **Final Choice**:  
   - Given the yellow button’s strong performance, it’s reasonable to exploit it further, especially since the other buttons have not shown higher rewards yet.

   - **Blue, Green, Red, Purple buttons**: Each pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.3333333333333333. These buttons have been explored minimally and could potentially have higher rewards.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - The yellow button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, so it’s a safe choice for exploitation.
   - However, the other buttons (blue, green, red, purple) have been pressed only 3 times each, which is not enough to confidently determine their true reward potential. We should explore them further to avoid missing out on potentially better options.

3. **Decision**:
   - Since the yellow button is performing well, it’s tempting to press it again. However, given that we’ve only explored the other buttons minimally, it’s worth exploring one of them to gather more data.
   - Let’s choose one of the under-explored buttons (blue, green, red, or purple) to balance exploration and exploitation.

Given the symmetry in the average rewards of the under-explored buttons, we can arbitrarily choose one. Let’s go with **blue** for this step.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The yellow button has the highest average reward (0.5555555555555556) and has been pressed 18 times. This suggests it is a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the yellow button is performing well, the other buttons (blue, green, red, purple) have been pressed fewer times (3-4 times each). Their average rewards are lower but could be due to insufficient sampling. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.

3. **Prioritizing Exploration**: Given that we have 100 time steps and have only used 31 so far, there is still ample opportunity to explore. The blue button, despite having a lower average reward (0.25), has only been pressed 4 times, which is fewer than the others. Exploring it further could provide more data to confirm or improve its performance.

4. **Decision**: While the yellow button is the safest choice for immediate reward, exploring the blue button could yield better long-term results if it turns out to have a higher true mean reward than currently observed.

1. **Current Best Performer**: The yellow button has the highest average reward (0.5555555555555556) based on 18 presses. This suggests that it might be the best button to press to maximize immediate rewards.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the yellow button looks promising, we have pressed it significantly more than the other buttons. The blue button, with an average reward of 0.4 over 5 presses, also shows potential but with less certainty due to fewer trials. The other buttons (green, red, purple) have lower average rewards and have been pressed only 3 times each, so there’s a chance they might perform better with more exploration.

3. **Strategy**: Given that we have 68 more time steps left, we should continue to explore the less-pressed buttons to a reasonable extent while still exploiting the yellow button, which has shown the best performance so far.

**Decision**: For this time step, to balance exploration and exploitation, we will press the **yellow button** again, as it has the highest average reward and we want to maximize our immediate gain while we continue to gather more data on the other buttons in subsequent steps.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons that have shown the highest average rewards so far and exploring the buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information about their potential rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button**: Highest average reward (0.5555) and has been pressed 9 times. It seems promising but needs further validation.  
   - **Yellow button**: Second-highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed 22 times. It’s a safe choice but might not yield higher rewards than blue.  
   - **Green, Red, Purple buttons**: All have the same low average reward (0.3333) and have been pressed only 3 times each. They need more exploration to determine if they could be better.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   - Since green, red, and purple buttons have been pressed the least, they are the most uncertain. We should explore them further to see if they might have higher true means than currently observed.  

3. **Choosing the Least Explored**:  
   - Among green, red, and purple, all have been pressed equally (3 times). We can choose any one of them for exploration. Let’s arbitrarily choose **green** for this step.

   - **Blue button**: Highest average reward (0.5556) with 9 presses. It seems promising but has been pressed relatively often.  
   - **Yellow button**: Second-highest average reward (0.5) with 22 presses. It’s been heavily explored but still a strong contender.  
   - **Green, Red, Purple buttons**: Lower average rewards (0.25, 0.3333, 0.3333) and fewer presses (4, 3, 3). These buttons need more exploration to confirm their true potential.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since the green, red, and purple buttons have been pressed fewer times, it’s worth exploring them further to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option.  

3. **Choosing the Least Explored Button**:  
   Among the green, red, and purple buttons, the **purple button** has the fewest presses (3) and an average reward of 0.3333, which is not significantly worse than the others. It’s a good candidate for exploration.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.6875) and has been pressed 16 times, which is a reasonable sample size to trust its average.  
   - The **yellow button** has a lower average reward (0.5) but has been pressed 22 times, indicating a stable estimate.  
   - The **green, red, and purple buttons** have low average rewards (0.25) and have been pressed only 4 times each. They might still have potential, but their current performance is not promising.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since the **blue button** has the highest average reward and a decent sample size, it is the best choice to maximize immediate reward.  
   - Exploring the under-sampled buttons (green, red, purple) is less critical at this stage, given their low performance so far.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.6176) and has been pressed the most (34 times), making it a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - The **green**, **red**, and **purple buttons** have been pressed only 4 times each, with an average reward of 0.25. This suggests they might not be as rewarding, but we have limited data, so further exploration could be beneficial.  
   - The **yellow button** has an average reward of 0.5, which is lower than blue but higher than the others, and it has been pressed 22 times.  

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 32 time steps left (100 - 68 = 32), we should focus more on exploitation while still exploring a bit to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better button.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - The **blue button** is the most promising based on current data, so it’s the best choice for exploitation.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between exploiting the button with the highest known average reward and exploring other buttons to gather more information about their potential rewards. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.6216) and has been pressed the most (37 times), making it the most reliable choice for exploitation.  
   - The **green**, **red**, and **purple buttons** have been pressed only 4 times each, with the same low average reward (0.25). This suggests they might not be as rewarding, but we have limited data.  
   - The **yellow button** has an average reward of 0.5, which is lower than blue but higher than the others, and it has been pressed 22 times.  

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 29 time steps left (100 - 71 = 29), we should focus on exploiting the button with the highest known reward while allocating a few trials to explore the less-pressed buttons (green, red, purple) to confirm their low rewards.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - The **blue button** is the best choice for exploitation given its high average reward and sufficient data.  
   - However, we should allocate a few trials to explore the under-explored buttons (green, red, purple) to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option.  

Given the remaining time steps, the optimal choice is to **exploit the blue button** while reserving a few trials for exploration later.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.631578947368421) based on 38 trials, making it the most promising choice for exploitation.  
   - The **green**, **red**, and **purple buttons** have been pressed only 4 times each, with an average reward of 0.25. This is significantly lower than the blue button, but the small sample size means their true means could be higher.  
   - The **yellow button** has an average reward of 0.5 based on 22 trials, which is lower than the blue button but still decent.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   - Since the green, red, and purple buttons have been pressed only 4 times each, their true means are highly uncertain. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards, especially if their true means are closer to the blue button's mean.  
   - The yellow button has been explored more, and its average reward is already known to be lower than the blue button's.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high uncertainty around the green, red, and purple buttons, it makes sense to explore one of them next. Since they have the same average reward and sample size, we can choose any one of them.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.631578947368421) and has been pressed the most (38 times). This suggests it is a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
   - The **yellow button** has a lower average reward (0.5) but has been pressed 22 times, indicating it might still be a decent option.  
   - The **green, red, and purple buttons** have been pressed fewer times (5, 4, and 4 respectively) and have lower average rewards (0.2, 0.25, and 0.25 respectively). These buttons are less explored and might have higher potential rewards, but the current data suggests they are less promising.

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 27 time steps left (100 - 73 = 27), we should focus more on **exploitation** to maximize the total reward.  
   - The **blue button** is the best choice based on its high average reward and the fact that it has been sufficiently explored.

3. **Final Decision**:

   Since we have only 20 time steps left, we should focus on exploiting the button with the highest known reward rather than exploring further. The **blue button** has the highest average reward and a sufficiently large sample size to trust its estimate.  

3. **Final Decision**:  
   Given the limited time and the high average reward of the blue button, it is the best choice to maximize the total reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.6739) and has been pressed the most (46 times). This suggests it is the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: The **green**, **red**, and **purple** buttons have been pressed very few times (5, 4, and 4 times, respectively), and their average rewards are lower (0.2, 0.25, and 0.25). However, since they have been pressed so few times, their true reward distributions are still uncertain. The **yellow button** has been pressed 22 times with an average reward of 0.5, which is lower than the blue button but still decent.

3. **Trade-off**: Given that we have only 19 time steps left (100 - 81 = 19), we should prioritize exploitation over exploration because we don’t have enough time to thoroughly explore the less-pressed buttons. The blue button is the safest bet for maximizing total reward.

**Final Decision**: Choose the **blue button** to maximize the expected reward based on the current information.

### Analysis:
1. **Blue Button**:  
   - Pressed 47 times with an average reward of **0.680851**.  
   - This is the highest average reward among all buttons, indicating it is the most promising choice for exploitation.

2. **Green, Red, and Purple Buttons**:  
   - These buttons have been pressed only 5, 4, and 4 times, respectively, with average rewards of **0.2**, **0.25**, and **0.25**.  
   - These averages are low, but the small sample size means there is uncertainty about their true reward distributions. Further exploration could reveal higher rewards.

3. **Yellow Button**:  
   - Pressed 22 times with an average reward of **0.5**.  
   - This is a decent reward, but lower than the blue button. It is less promising for exploitation but could still be worth exploring further.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The blue button has the highest average reward and a large sample size, making it the safest choice for maximizing immediate rewards.  
- **Exploration**: The green, red, and purple buttons have been under-explored, and their true reward distributions are uncertain. Exploring these buttons could potentially uncover higher rewards.

### Decision:
Given that we have only 18 time steps left, the priority should be **exploitation** to maximize the total reward. The blue button is the most reliable choice based on the current data.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.714) and has been pressed the most (56 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
   - The **green**, **red**, and **purple buttons** have been pressed fewer times (5, 4, and 4 times respectively) and have lower average rewards (0.2, 0.25, and 0.25 respectively). They may have higher true means, but we lack sufficient data to confirm this.  
   - The **yellow button** has a moderate average reward (0.5) and has been pressed 22 times, but it’s still worth considering for exploration.

2. **Remaining Time Steps**:  
   - We have **9** time steps left. Given the limited time, focusing on the button with the highest known reward (blue) is a safer strategy to maximize total reward.  
   - Exploring other buttons (e.g., green, red, purple) is riskier because their average rewards are significantly lower, and we don’t have enough evidence to suggest they could outperform blue.

3. **Decision**:  
   - The **blue button** is the best choice for exploitation, as it has the highest average reward and sufficient data to support its reliability.

### Analysis:
1. **Blue Button**:  
   - Pressed 57 times with an average reward of **0.701754**.  
   - This is the highest average reward among all buttons, indicating it is the most promising choice for exploitation.

2. **Green, Red, and Purple Buttons**:  
   - These buttons have been pressed only 5, 4, and 4 times, respectively, with average rewards of **0.2**, **0.25**, and **0.25**.  
   - These low averages and limited data suggest they are less likely to yield high rewards, but they are under-explored and could potentially have higher true means.

3. **Yellow Button**:  
   - Pressed 22 times with an average reward of **0.5**.  
   - This is a moderate reward, but significantly lower than the blue button.

### Decision:
Given that we only have 8 time steps left, **exploitation** is more critical than exploration. The blue button has the highest average reward and sufficient data to support its reliability. While the green, red, and purple buttons are under-explored, their low average rewards and limited time remaining make them less attractive.

3. **Consider the number of times each button has been pressed:**
   - The blue button has been pressed the most (64 times), which gives us more confidence in its average reward.
   - The green, red, and purple buttons have been pressed fewer times, so their average rewards are less reliable.
