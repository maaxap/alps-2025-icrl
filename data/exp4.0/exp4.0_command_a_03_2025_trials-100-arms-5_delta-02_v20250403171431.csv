Given that all buttons have been pressed 0 times, we can start by arbitrarily choosing any button. A simple and fair approach is to select buttons in a round-robin fashion or randomly. Since no button has been pressed yet, we can start with any color.

Exploration involves trying out buttons we haven't pressed yet to gather more information about their reward distributions. Exploitation involves pressing buttons that have already shown promising rewards to maximize immediate gains.

1. **Current Information**:  
   - **Blue**: Pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0.  
   - **Green**: Pressed 1 time, average reward 1.0.  
   - **Red, Yellow, Purple**: Not pressed yet, so their rewards are unknown.  

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Green** has the highest observed reward so far (1.0), making it the best choice for exploitation.  
   - However, we have only pressed two buttons so far, and three buttons (Red, Yellow, Purple) remain unexplored. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.  

3. **Strategy for Early Stages**:  
   In the early stages of the game, it’s beneficial to explore more to gather information about the buttons. Since we’ve already tried Blue and Green, the next logical step is to try one of the unexplored buttons.  

4. **Choosing the Next Button**:

   - **Blue, Red, Yellow buttons**: Each pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not shown any reward yet, but they have been pressed the least, so there is potential for higher rewards.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - **Exploitation**: Based on the current data, the green and purple buttons are the most promising. However, we should not ignore the other buttons completely, as they might have higher rewards that we haven’t discovered yet.
   - **Exploration**: The blue, red, and yellow buttons have been pressed only once, which is not enough to conclude that they are not rewarding. We should explore these buttons further to gather more data.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - Since the green button has the highest average reward and has been pressed more times, it is a safe choice for exploitation.
   - However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing one of the less-pressed buttons (blue, red, or yellow) to gather more information.

4. **Final Choice**:
   - Given that we have only 100 time steps and we need to maximize the total reward, it’s reasonable to exploit the green button more since it has shown the best performance so far.

- **Exploration**: Try buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information and potentially find a better option. This could mean trying one of the blue, red, or yellow buttons.

Given that we have 100 time steps and we are only at step 11, it's still early in the game. We should balance exploitation and exploration. However, since the purple button has shown the highest average reward so far and has been pressed only twice, it is a good candidate for both exploitation and further exploration.

   - **Purple button**: Pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.3333. This is the second-highest average reward.
   - **Blue, Red, Yellow buttons**: Each pressed once with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not shown any reward yet, but they have been explored minimally.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - The **green button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, so it is a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - The **purple button** also shows a decent average reward and could be worth exploring further.
   - The **blue, red, and yellow buttons** have not been explored much, and their true reward potential is still uncertain.

3. **Decision**:
   - Since the **green button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed more times, it is the safest choice for exploitation.
   - However, to ensure we are not missing out on potentially better rewards from other buttons, we should also consider exploring the **purple button** further, as it has shown a decent average reward with fewer presses.
   - Given that we have only 11 out of 100 time steps completed, there is still ample time for exploration. However, the **green button** remains the most promising based on current data.

1. **Current Data Analysis**:  
   - **Green button**: Pressed 10 times, average reward 0.3.  
   - **Purple button**: Pressed 6 times, average reward 0.5.  
   - **Blue, Red, Yellow buttons**: Pressed 1-2 times each, average reward 0.0.  

2. **Key Observations**:  
   - **Purple button** has the highest average reward (0.5) but fewer trials (6) compared to the green button (10 trials).  
   - **Green button** has a lower average reward (0.3) but more trials, indicating more certainty about its performance.  
   - **Blue, Red, and Yellow buttons** have very limited data and no rewards yet, so their true means are still highly uncertain.  

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - **Exploitation**: Choosing the purple button maximizes immediate reward based on current data.  
   - **Exploration**: Testing the blue, red, or yellow buttons could reveal higher rewards, but the risk is higher due to lack of data.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Given the goal is to maximize total reward over 100 time steps, it’s better to exploit the button with the highest known reward while still exploring underperforming buttons occasionally. However, since purple has the highest average reward so far, it’s the safest choice for now.

   - **Red**: 2 presses, average reward 0.0  
   - **Yellow**: 1 press, average reward 0.0  
   - **Purple**: 7 presses, average reward 0.5714  

2. **Key Observations**:
   - **Purple** has the highest average reward (0.5714) among all buttons, despite being pressed fewer times than **Green**.  
   - **Green** has a moderate average reward (0.3) and has been pressed the most, suggesting it might be a reliable choice.  
   - **Blue**, **Red**, and **Yellow** have very limited data (1 or 2 presses) and no rewards, so their true potential is still uncertain.  

3. **Strategy**:
   - **Exploitation**: Choose the button with the highest known reward to maximize immediate gains.  
   - **Exploration**: Test buttons with limited data to gather more information and potentially discover better options.  

4. **Decision**:
   - **Purple** is the most promising based on current data, as it has the highest average reward.  
   - However, **Blue**, **Red**, and **Yellow** have not been explored much, and one of them might have a higher mean reward.  
   - Given the goal is to maximize total reward over 100 time steps, it’s worth exploring **Blue**, **Red**, or **Yellow** to reduce uncertainty.  

5. **Final Choice**:
   - Since **Purple** has the highest known reward, it’s the safest choice for exploitation.  
   - However, to balance exploration and exploitation, we should test one of the under-explored buttons.  

Given the limited exploration of **Blue**, **Red**, and **Yellow**, and the fact that **Purple** has already been pressed 7 times, let’s explore **Blue** next to gather more data.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 10 times with an average reward of 0.3.  
   - This has a lower average reward compared to blue and purple, and we have a more reliable estimate due to the higher number of trials.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 8 times with an average reward of 0.5.  
   - This is another promising option, with a higher number of trials than blue, making the estimate more reliable.

- The **blue** and **purple** buttons have the highest average rewards (0.5).  
- **Purple** has been pressed more times (8) compared to blue (2), making its average reward more reliable.

- The **red and yellow buttons** have not yielded rewards yet, but they have been pressed very few times. Exploring them could reveal higher rewards, but it's riskier given the limited data.
- The **green and purple buttons** have more consistent but lower average rewards.

Given the goal is to maximize total reward, the **blue button** seems like the best choice at this point, as it has the highest observed average reward, even though it has been pressed fewer times.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 7 times with an average reward of 0.42857142857142855. This is the highest average reward among all buttons, but it has been pressed relatively fewer times compared to green and purple.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 10 times with an average reward of 0.3. This is a moderate reward, but it has been pressed more frequently than blue.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.0. This button has not yielded any reward so far, but it has been pressed very few times.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. Similar to red, it has not yielded any reward, but it has been pressed only once.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 11 times with an average reward of 0.36363636363636365. This is a slightly higher reward than green and has been pressed the most frequently.

**Strategy**:
- **Exploitation**: Choose the button with the highest average reward to maximize immediate gains. In this case, the blue button has the highest average reward.
- **Exploration**: Try buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information about their potential rewards. The red and yellow buttons have been pressed very few times and have shown no reward, but they might have higher potential.

Given that we have 69 more time steps left, it's important to balance exploitation and exploration. However, since the blue button has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, it seems like a good choice to maximize immediate rewards while still having room to explore other buttons later.

   - **Purple**: 0.3636 (pressed 11 times)

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:
   - **Yellow** has the highest average reward (0.5) but has been pressed only 4 times, which is fewer compared to Blue and Purple. This suggests that Yellow might be a good candidate for further exploration to confirm its high reward potential.
   - **Red** has the lowest average reward (0.0) and has been pressed only 3 times. It might be worth exploring further to see if it has a higher reward potential than currently observed.
   - **Blue** and **Purple** have similar average rewards (0.3636) and have been pressed 11 times each, which is a good amount of data. However, they are not the best performers so far.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given that **Yellow** has shown the highest average reward and has been pressed relatively fewer times, it is a strong candidate for the next press to both exploit its high reward potential and gather more data.

   - **Blue** and **Purple** have similar average rewards (0.3636) but have been pressed more frequently, so their estimates are more reliable.  
   - **Green** has a lower average reward (0.3) and has been pressed 10 times, making its estimate relatively reliable.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - **Exploitation vs. Exploration**: Since we have 60 time steps left, we should balance exploiting the best-known option (Yellow) with exploring under-sampled options (Red) to confirm their true performance.  
   - **Yellow** is the most promising based on current data, but we should also consider exploring **Red** to ensure it’s not a better option than it seems.

Given that we have 52 time steps remaining and the goal is to maximize total reward, it’s more prudent to exploit the button with the highest known reward rather than risk exploring a button with a lower average reward.

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:
   - **Yellow** has the highest average reward (0.3846) and has been pressed the most (13 times), indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Red** has the lowest average reward (0.2500) but has been pressed the least (4 times), suggesting it might be worth exploring further to see if its true mean is higher.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given that we have only 51 time steps left, it’s crucial to focus on buttons with higher average rewards to maximize total reward. However, exploring **Red** a bit more could be beneficial since it has been pressed the least and its true mean might be higher than what we’ve observed so far.

Considering the balance between exploitation and exploration, and given the limited time steps remaining, the best choice is to **exploit the button with the highest average reward** while keeping an eye on under-explored buttons.

   - Blue and Purple are the best options based on current data, but further exploration of Red could be beneficial.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the goal is to maximize total reward, we should balance exploitation (choosing the best-known option) and exploration (testing less-known options).

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.4167) among all buttons, based on the data so far. This suggests it might be the best choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: The **red button** has been pressed the least (only 5 times) and has a low average reward (0.2). However, since it has been pressed so few times, its true mean could be higher than what we've observed. Exploring it further could reveal a better reward distribution.

3. **Balancing Act**: Given that we have 48 time steps remaining (100 - 52 = 48), we can afford to explore a bit more while still exploiting the best-known option. However, the blue button's performance is significantly better than the others, so it’s a safer choice.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Average Rewards**:
   - Blue: 0.357 (14 presses)
   - Green: 0.3 (10 presses)
   - Red: 0.333 (9 presses)
   - Yellow: 0.357 (14 presses)
   - Purple: 0.364 (11 presses)

2. **Exploitation**:
   - Purple has the highest average reward (0.364), making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - Blue and Yellow have similar average rewards (0.357), but they have been pressed more frequently than Purple.

3. **Exploration**:
   - Red and Green have been pressed fewer times (9 and 10, respectively) and have lower average rewards. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher potential rewards.

4. **Decision**:
   - Purple is the best choice for exploitation based on its highest average reward.
   - However, since we still have 42 time steps left, it’s worth exploring Red or Green to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better button.

5. **Final Choice**:
   - Given that Purple has the highest average reward and has been pressed fewer times than Blue and Yellow, it’s a good balance between exploitation and exploration.

   - Green has the lowest average reward (0.3) and has been pressed 10 times.
   - Red has been pressed the least (9 times), so it might still have potential.

3. **Strategy**:
   - **Exploitation**: Purple has the highest reward so far, so pressing it again is a safe choice.
   - **Exploration**: Red has been pressed the least and has a moderate average reward, so it’s worth exploring further.

4. **Decision**:
   - Since we’re only 60 time steps in (with 40 remaining), we can afford to explore a bit more. However, Purple’s high reward makes it a strong candidate for exploitation.

Given the balance between exploration and exploitation, and the fact that Purple has the highest average reward, the best choice is to press **Purple** again to maximize immediate reward while still having time to explore other buttons later.

   - Yellow and Purple have the highest average rewards (0.3571), but they have been pressed fewer times compared to Blue.  
   - Blue has a slightly lower average (0.35) but has been pressed more times, so its reward estimate is more reliable.  

3. **Exploration**:  
   - Red and Green have been pressed fewer times (9 and 10, respectively), so their true rewards might be higher than their current averages.  
   - Exploring these buttons could reveal better options.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Since Yellow and Purple have the highest current averages, they are strong candidates for exploitation.  
   - However, Blue has a reliable estimate and is close in reward, so it’s also a good choice.  
   - Red and Green are worth exploring, but their current averages are lower, so they are less attractive.  

Given the remaining time steps (33), it’s better to focus on buttons with higher rewards to maximize total reward. **Yellow and Purple** are tied for the highest average, but since they have been pressed equally, we can choose either.

This is a classic exploration-exploitation problem, where we need to balance between choosing buttons that have shown good performance (exploitation) and trying buttons that have been pressed less frequently to gather more information (exploration).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The blue button has the highest average reward (0.35) among all buttons, and it has been pressed 20 times, which is a reasonable number of trials to estimate its mean. This suggests that the blue button is a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Exploration**: The green button has been pressed only 10 times, which is fewer than the other buttons. Its average reward (0.3) is lower than the blue button, but it still has potential, and further exploration could reveal a higher mean.

3. **Other Buttons**: The red, yellow, and purple buttons have similar average rewards (0.3333) and have been pressed 9, 15, and 18 times, respectively. These buttons are less promising than the blue button in terms of exploitation, and their exploration potential is lower compared to the green button.

Given the current information, the **blue button** is the best choice for exploitation, as it has the highest average reward and a sufficient number of trials to estimate its mean. While exploration is important, the remaining time steps (28 out of 100) are limited, so focusing on the button with the highest known reward is a more reliable strategy.

1. **Average Rewards**:  
   - Blue: 0.3636 (highest average reward, but pressed 22 times, so its estimate is relatively stable).  
   - Green: 0.3 (pressed only 10 times, so its estimate is less reliable).

   - Purple: 0.3333 (pressed 18 times, moderate reliability).  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - Buttons with fewer presses (Green and Red) have higher uncertainty, so exploring them further could reveal higher rewards.  
   - Blue has the highest average reward, but its estimate is more stable, so further presses are less likely to yield surprises.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 25 time steps left, we should prioritize buttons with the highest **potential** for higher rewards.  
   - Blue is the safest choice based on current data, but exploring Green or Red could yield better results if their true means are higher than estimated.

Given the remaining time steps (24), it’s still worth exploring the less-pressed buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option. However, for this step, the blue button remains the most promising based on current data.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **blue**, **yellow**, and **purple** buttons have the highest average reward of 0.3333, but they have been pressed 24, 15, and 18 times, respectively.  
   - The **green** and **red** buttons have been pressed only 10 times each, with an average reward of 0.3. These buttons have been explored less, so there’s a chance their true reward could be higher.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we still have 23 time steps left (100 - 77 = 23), it’s worth exploring the less-pressed buttons to confirm their reward distributions.  

3. **Choosing the Least Explored Button**:  
   Both **green** and **red** have been pressed 10 times, which is the least among all buttons. Since their average rewards are equal, we can choose either one.  

Given the need to explore, I’ll choose the **green** button next.

   - **Green** has the lowest average reward (0.2727) and has been pressed only 11 times, so it might be worth exploring further, but its current performance is not promising.
   - **Red**, **Yellow**, and **Purple** have similar average rewards (around 0.33), but **Red** has been pressed the least (10 times), so it might still have some potential for higher rewards.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given that **Blue** has the highest average reward and a sufficient number of trials, it is the safest choice for exploitation.
   - However, since we still have 21 time steps left (100 - 79 = 21), we should also consider exploring **Red** a bit more to confirm its potential, as it has been pressed the least among the buttons with similar average rewards.

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.3846) among all buttons. It has been pressed 26 times, which is a reasonable number of trials to estimate its mean reward.

2. **Exploration**: The **green button** has the lowest average reward (0.2727) but has only been pressed 11 times. This is the least number of trials among all buttons, so there is more uncertainty about its true mean reward. It might be worth exploring further.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 14 time steps, we need to consider both the **exploitation** (choosing the button with the highest known average reward) and **exploration** (trying less-pressed buttons to gather more information about their potential rewards).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The blue button has the highest average reward (0.4375) among all buttons. It has been pressed 32 times, which is a reasonable number of trials to estimate its mean reward.

2. **Exploration**: The green button has the lowest average reward (0.2727) but has only been pressed 11 times. This is the least number of trials among all buttons, so there’s a higher uncertainty about its true mean reward. However, given its low average reward so far, exploring it further might not yield significant gains.

3. **Remaining Buttons**: The red, yellow, and purple buttons have similar average rewards (around 0.33) and have been pressed a moderate number of times (10, 15, and 18 respectively). There’s less uncertainty about their rewards compared to the green button.

4. **Decision**: Since the blue button has the highest average reward and has been sufficiently explored, it is the best choice for exploitation. Exploring other buttons (especially the green one) might not yield better results given the limited time steps remaining.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.4411764705882353) and has been pressed 34 times, giving us a relatively reliable estimate of its mean.  
2. **Exploration**: The **green button** has the lowest average reward (0.2727272727272727) but has only been pressed 11 times, which is fewer than the other buttons. This suggests it might be worth exploring further to confirm its low reward.  
3. **Other Buttons**: The **red**, **yellow**, and **purple** buttons have similar average rewards (around 0.33) and have been pressed a moderate number of times (10, 15, and 18 respectively). They are less promising than the blue button but could still be worth exploring.

### Decision:
Given that we only have 12 time steps left, **exploitation** is more critical than exploration. The **blue button** has the highest average reward and a reasonably reliable estimate, making it the best choice to maximize immediate rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The blue button has the highest average reward (0.38095) among all buttons. It has been pressed 42 times, which is a substantial number, giving us confidence in its average reward.

2. **Exploration**: The green, red, yellow, and purple buttons have been pressed fewer times, and their average rewards are lower than the blue button. However, since we only have 4 time steps left, exploration is less critical because we won’t have enough time to significantly improve our estimates of their rewards.

3. **Decision**: Given the limited time remaining, the best strategy is to **exploit** the button with the highest known average reward to maximize the expected total reward.

Thus, the optimal choice is the **blue button**.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The blue button has the highest average reward (0.3953) among all buttons, based on the data collected so far. It has been pressed 43 times, which is a reasonable sample size to trust its average reward.

2. **Exploration**: The green, red, yellow, and purple buttons have been pressed fewer times, and their average rewards are lower than the blue button. However, with only 3 time steps left, exploring these buttons is unlikely to yield significant new information or higher rewards.

3. **Decision**: Given the limited time steps remaining (3), the best strategy is to **exploit** the button with the highest known average reward to maximize the expected total reward.

Therefore, the optimal choice is the **blue button**.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 2 time steps, we should focus on the button with the highest average reward so far, as it has demonstrated the best performance. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the average rewards**:  
   - Blue: 0.4091  
   - Green: 0.2727  
   - Red: 0.3000  
   - Yellow: 0.3333  
   - Purple: 0.3333  

2. **Identify the best-performing button**:  
   The blue button has the highest average reward (0.4091), making it the most promising choice.  

3. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**:  
   With only 2 time steps left, exploration is less critical. We should exploit the button with the highest known reward to maximize the total reward.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The blue button is the best choice based on its superior average reward.
