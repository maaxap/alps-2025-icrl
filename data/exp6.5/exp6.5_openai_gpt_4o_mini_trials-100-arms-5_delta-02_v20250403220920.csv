1. **Blue Button**: The reward is extremely positive, but the reliability is low because it has only been pressed once. This suggests that while the reward was good, it may not be consistent.

2. **Green Button**: The reward is extremely negative, but again, the reliability is low due to only one press. This indicates that it is likely not a good choice moving forward.

3. **Red Button**: The reward is unknown, and it has not been pressed yet. This means there is potential for a good reward, but we have no information to guide us.

5. **Purple Button**: Like the red and yellow buttons, the reward is unknown, and it has not been pressed yet.

Given that the blue button has shown a positive reward but with low reliability, it may not be the best choice for the next step. The green button is clearly a poor choice due to its negative reward. 

The red, yellow, and purple buttons are all untested, which means they could potentially yield better rewards. Since we have no prior information about them, I will choose one of these buttons.

   - Reliability: Moderate (pressed 13 times)
   
5. **Purple button**: 
   - Reward: Extremely negative
   - Reliability: Low (pressed 1 time)

From this summary, we can draw the following conclusions:

- The **Blue button** has a positive reward, which is promising, but its reliability is low due to being pressed only 5 times. However, it is still the best option based on the reward.
- The **Green**, **Red**, and **Purple buttons** have extremely negative rewards, making them poor choices.
- The **Yellow button** has a negative reward but has been pressed 13 times, indicating some level of reliability, though it is still not a good option.

Given that the Blue button has a positive reward and is the only button with a non-negative reward, it is the best choice for the next step.

Therefore, I will choose the Blue button.

1. **Blue button**: 
   - Reward: Positive
   - Reliability: Reliable (pressed 26 times)
   - This button has shown consistent positive rewards and has been pressed enough times to establish reliability.

2. **Green button**: 
   - Reward: Extremely negative
   - Reliability: Low (pressed only 1 time)
   - This button has shown a very negative reward, and since it has only been pressed once, it is not reliable.

3. **Red button**: 
   - Reward: Extremely negative
   - Reliability: Low (pressed only 1 time)
   - Similar to the green button, it has shown a very negative reward and is not reliable.

4. **Yellow button**: 
   - Reward: Negative
   - Reliability: Moderate (pressed 13 times)
   - This button has shown negative rewards but has been pressed enough times to have some reliability. However, it is still not a good option compared to blue.

5. **Purple button**: 
   - Reward: Extremely negative
   - Reliability: Low (pressed only 1 time)
   - Like the green and red buttons, it has shown a very negative reward and is not reliable.

Given this analysis, the blue button is the only one that has shown a positive reward and has a reliable history. The other buttons either have negative rewards or low reliability.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the blue button.

- The **Red button** has also been pressed only once and has an extremely negative reward, making it a poor choice.

1. **Blue button**: Has a positive reward and has been pressed 70 times, indicating a reliable performance.
2. **Green button**: Extremely negative reward but has only been pressed once, indicating low reliability.
3. **Red button**: Extremely negative reward with low reliability (pressed once).
4. **Yellow button**: Negative reward with moderate reliability (pressed 13 times).
5. **Purple button**: Extremely negative reward with low reliability (pressed once).

Given that the blue button has shown a positive reward and has been pressed many times, it is the most reliable option. The other buttons either have negative rewards or have been pressed too few times to draw any reliable conclusions.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the blue button.

- The **Yellow button** has been pressed 13 times and has a negative reward, indicating it is not very reliable but slightly better than the buttons pressed only once.
- The **Purple button** has been pressed only once and has an extremely negative reward, which makes it a bad option.

Given that the Blue button has a strong positive reward and has been pressed many times, it is the best option to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the Blue button.

Each button is associated with a Bernoulli distribution with a fixed but unknown mean; the means for the buttons could be different. For each button, when you press it, you will get a reward that is sampled from the button's associated distribution. You have 100 time steps and, on each time step, you can choose any button and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps.

At each time step, I will show you a summary of your past choices and rewards. Then you must make the next choice, which must be exactly one of blue, red, green, yellow, purple.

as follows:
- Blue button: Blue's reward is positive (reliability of reward: Blue button reliability is reliable (pressed 81 times)).
- Green button: Green's reward is extremely negative (reliability of reward: Green button reliability is low reliability (pressed only 1 times)).
- Red button: Red's reward is extremely negative (reliability of reward: Red button reliability is low reliability (pressed only 1 times)).
- Yellow button: Yellow's reward is negative (reliability of reward: Yellow button reliability is moderate reliability (pressed 13 times)).
- Purple button: Purple's reward is extremely negative (reliability of reward: Purple button reliability is low reliability (pressed only 1 times)).

Low reliability indicates that the sentiment can change.

- The **Blue button** has been pressed 81 times and has a positive reward, indicating it is a reliable choice.
- The **Green button** has been pressed only once and has an extremely negative reward, suggesting it is not a good option.
- The **Red button** has also been pressed only once and has an extremely negative reward, making it a poor choice as well.
- The **Yellow button** has been pressed 13 times and has a negative reward, indicating it is not very reliable but might be better than the buttons pressed only once.
- The **Purple button** has been pressed only once and has an extremely negative reward, which makes it a bad option.

Given that the Blue button has shown a positive reward and has been pressed the most times, it is the most reliable option. The other buttons either have low reliability or have shown negative rewards.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the Blue button.
