Given that the yellow button has shown an extremely negative reward, it is not a viable option. The other buttons (blue, green, red, and purple) have shown positive rewards, but their reliability is low due to the limited number of presses.

Among the options, the purple button stands out because it has shown an extremely positive reward, even though it has only been pressed once. This suggests that it might have a high mean reward, and since we are trying to maximize total reward, it is worth exploring further.

Considering the above points, I will choose the purple button for the next press.

Since the yellow button has shown an extremely negative reward, it is not a viable option. The other buttons (blue, green, red, and purple) have all yielded positive rewards, but they have low reliability due to the limited number of times they have been pressed.

To maximize the total reward, I should choose one of the buttons that have shown positive rewards. Since the red button has been pressed the least (only 2 times), it might be worth exploring further to see if it continues to yield positive rewards.

### Analysis:
- The **Red** and **Yellow** buttons have shown negative rewards, so they are not good choices.
- The **Blue**, **Green**, and **Purple** buttons have shown positive rewards, but their reliability is low due to the limited number of times they have been pressed.
- Since the **Yellow** button has been extremely negative and only pressed once, it is not a viable option.
- The **Red** button has consistently given negative rewards, so it should also be avoided.

### Decision:
Given that the Blue, Green, and Purple buttons have all yielded positive rewards, I should choose one of these. Since the Purple button has been pressed the least (2 times), it might still have potential for a better reward. However, both Blue and Green have shown positive rewards as well.

To maximize the potential for a positive reward, I will choose the **Blue button**, as it has shown a positive reward and has been pressed a few times, indicating some reliability despite being low.

1. **Blue button**: Positive reward, but low reliability (pressed 10 times).
2. **Green button**: Positive reward, but very low reliability (pressed only 3 times).
3. **Red button**: Negative reward, low reliability (pressed only 3 times).
4. **Yellow button**: Extremely negative reward, very low reliability (pressed only 1 time).
5. **Purple button**: Negative reward, low reliability (pressed only 3 times).

Given that the blue and green buttons have shown positive rewards, they are the most promising options. However, the blue button has been pressed more times, which gives us a slightly better understanding of its reliability. The green button, while also positive, has been pressed very few times, making its reliability uncertain.

The red, yellow, and purple buttons have shown negative rewards, which suggests they are not good choices at this time.

Considering the above points, I will choose the blue button for the next trial, as it has the most data and has shown a positive reward.

2. **Green button**: Positive reward but low reliability. It has only been pressed 3 times, so we have less information about its true performance.
3. **Red button**: Negative reward with low reliability. It has also been pressed 3 times, but the negative outcome suggests it may not be a good choice.
4. **Yellow button**: Extremely negative reward with very low reliability. It has only been pressed once, and the outcome was poor, making it a very bad choice.

1. **Blue button**: 
   - Reward: Positive
   - Reliability: Moderate (pressed 20 times)
   - This button has a decent amount of data, and it has shown positive rewards, making it a strong candidate.

2. **Green button**: 
   - Reward: Positive
   - Reliability: Low (pressed only 3 times)
   - Although it has shown positive rewards, the low reliability means we have very little data to trust its performance.

3. **Red button**: 
   - Reward: Negative
   - Reliability: Low (pressed only 3 times)
   - This button has consistently shown negative rewards, making it a poor choice.

4. **Yellow button**: 
   - Reward: Extremely negative
   - Reliability: Low (pressed only 1 time)
   - This button has shown the worst performance and should be avoided.

5. **Purple button**: 
   - Reward: Negative
   - Reliability: Low (pressed only 3 times)
   - Similar to the red button, this one has also shown negative rewards and is not a good option.

Given this analysis, the best choice is the **Blue button**, as it has shown positive rewards with moderate reliability, making it the most trustworthy option based on the data we have.

   - Conclusion: This button has a strong positive reward and is reliable, making it a good choice.

2. **Green button**: 
   - Reward: Positive
   - Reliability: Low (pressed only 3 times)
   - Conclusion: While it has a positive reward, the low reliability means it could be inconsistent. However, it might still be worth exploring further.

3. **Red button**: 
   - Reward: Negative
   - Reliability: Low (pressed only 3 times)
   - Conclusion: This button has a negative reward and low reliability, so it is not a good choice.

4. **Yellow button**: 
   - Reward: Extremely negative
   - Reliability: Low (pressed only 1 time)
   - Conclusion: This button is the worst choice due to its extremely negative reward.

5. **Purple button**: 
   - Reward: Negative
   - Reliability: Low (pressed only 3 times)
   - Conclusion: Similar to the red button, this one has a negative reward and low reliability, making it a poor choice.

Given this analysis, the blue button stands out as the best option due to its reliable positive reward. The green button, while positive, has low reliability and is less tested.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the blue button.

1. **Blue button**: Positive reward and has been pressed 42 times, indicating a reliable source of reward.
2. **Green button**: Positive reward but has low reliability due to being pressed only 3 times. This means we have limited information about its true mean.
3. **Red button**: Negative reward and low reliability (pressed only 3 times). This is not a good choice.
4. **Yellow button**: Extremely negative reward and very low reliability (pressed only 1 time). This is the worst choice.
5. **Purple button**: Negative reward and low reliability (pressed only 3 times). This is also not a good choice.

Given that the blue button has shown a positive reward and has been pressed many times, it is the most reliable option. The green button, while positive, has too little data to confidently choose it over the blue button.

1. **Blue button**: Positive reward and has been pressed 53 times, indicating a reliable source of reward.
2. **Green button**: Positive reward but has low reliability due to being pressed only 3 times. This means it could potentially yield a good reward, but we don't have enough data to be confident.
3. **Red button**: Negative reward and low reliability (pressed only 3 times). This is not a good choice.
4. **Yellow button**: Extremely negative reward and very low reliability (pressed only 1 time). This is definitely not a good choice.
5. **Purple button**: Negative reward and low reliability (pressed only 3 times). This is also not a good choice.

Given that the blue button has shown a positive reward and has a high reliability due to the number of times it has been pressed, it is the safest and most logical choice to maximize the total reward.

1. **Blue button**: Has a positive reward and has been pressed 64 times, indicating a reliable source of reward.
2. **Green button**: Also has a positive reward but has only been pressed 3 times, indicating low reliability. However, it could still be a potential option since it has a positive reward.
3. **Red button**: Has a negative reward and low reliability, making it a poor choice.
4. **Yellow button**: Extremely negative reward and low reliability, making it the worst choice.
5. **Purple button**: Negative reward and low reliability, also a poor choice.

Given that the blue button has a high reliability and a positive reward, it is the best option to maximize the total reward. The green button, while positive, has low reliability and has been pressed very few times, making it less favorable compared to the blue button.

1. **Blue button**: It has been pressed 75 times and has a positive reward with reliable performance. This indicates that it is a strong candidate for maximizing rewards.

2. **Green button**: Although it has a positive reward, it has only been pressed 3 times, which means its reliability is low. The positive reward could be a fluke, and we don't have enough data to trust it fully.

3. **Red button**: It has a negative reward and low reliability, which suggests that it is not a good choice.

4. **Yellow button**: It has an extremely negative reward and has been pressed only once, indicating it is not a viable option.

5. **Purple button**: Similar to the red button, it has a negative reward and low reliability, making it a poor choice as well.

Given this analysis, the blue button stands out as the best option due to its high reliability and positive reward.

Which button will you choose next? Remember, YOU MUST provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>COLOR</Answer> where COLOR is one of blue, red, green, yellow, purple. Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","Based on the summary of past choices and rewards:

1. **Blue button**: It has been pressed 86 times and has a positive reward with reliable performance. This indicates that it is a strong candidate for maximizing rewards.

2. **Green button**: Although it has a positive reward, it has only been pressed 3 times, which means its reliability is low. The positive reward could be a fluke, and we don't have enough data to trust it fully.

3. **Red button**: It has a negative reward and low reliability, having been pressed only 3 times. This button is not a good choice.

4. **Yellow button**: It has an extremely negative reward and has been pressed only once. This button should be avoided.

5. **Purple button**: It has a negative reward and low reliability, having been pressed only 3 times. This button is also not a good choice.

Given this analysis, the best option is to continue pressing the **Blue button**, as it has shown reliable positive rewards over a significant number of trials.

Therefore, my final answer is:

1. **Blue button**: Has a positive reward and has been pressed 87 times, indicating a high reliability. This is a strong candidate for the next choice.
2. **Green button**: Also has a positive reward but has only been pressed 3 times, indicating low reliability. While it has potential, the uncertainty is high.
3. **Red button**: Has a negative reward and low reliability. This is not a good choice.
4. **Yellow button**: Extremely negative reward and low reliability. This is the worst choice.
5. **Purple button**: Negative reward and low reliability. This is also not a good choice.

Given that the blue button has shown consistent positive rewards and high reliability, it is the best option for maximizing total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the blue button.
