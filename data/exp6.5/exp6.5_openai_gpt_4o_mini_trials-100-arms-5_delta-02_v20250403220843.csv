Which button will you choose next? Remember, YOU MUST provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>COLOR</Answer> where COLOR is one of blue, red, green, yellow, purple. Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","Based on the summary of past choices and rewards, we can analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Blue Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. This indicates a very low reliability and suggests that this button is not a good choice.
  
2. **Green Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. Similar to the blue button, this is also a poor choice.

3. **Red Button**: Negative reward, pressed three times. While it has been pressed more than the blue and green buttons, it still has a negative reward, indicating it may not be a good option.

4. **Yellow Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. This button is also not a viable option.

5. **Purple Button**: Negative reward, pressed five times. This button has the most data points, but it still has a negative reward.

Given that all buttons have shown negative rewards, the best strategy is to choose the button with the most data points, which is the purple button. This choice is based on the idea that it may have a higher chance of yielding a better reward than the others, which have shown extremely negative outcomes.

Therefore, I will choose the purple button next.

- Blue button: Extremely negative reward, low reliability (pressed only 1 time).
- Green button: Extremely negative reward, low reliability (pressed only 1 time).
- Red button: Negative reward, low reliability (pressed 3 times).
- Yellow button: Extremely negative reward, low reliability (pressed only 1 time).
- Purple button: Positive reward, reliable (pressed 27 times).

From this information, it is clear that the Purple button has consistently provided positive rewards and has a high reliability due to the number of times it has been pressed. The other buttons have either extremely negative rewards or low reliability, indicating that they are not good choices at this time.

Given that the goal is to maximize total reward, the best choice is to continue pressing the Purple button.

5. **Purple Button**: Positive reward, pressed 72 times. This button has a reliable positive reward, making it the best option among all the buttons.

Since the purple button has shown a consistent positive reward and has been pressed the most times, it is the most reliable choice.

1. **Blue Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. This indicates a very low reliability and suggests that this button is not a good choice.
  
2. **Green Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. Similar to the blue button, this indicates a very low reliability and suggests that this button is also not a good choice.

3. **Red Button**: Negative reward, pressed three times. While it has been pressed more than the blue and green buttons, it still has a negative reward, indicating it is not a favorable option.

4. **Yellow Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. This button also shows very low reliability and is not a good choice.

5. **Purple Button**: Positive reward, pressed 83 times. This button has a reliable positive reward, making it the best option among all the buttons.

Given that the purple button has shown consistent positive rewards and has been pressed the most times, it is the most reliable choice. 

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the purple button.
