1. **Blue Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. Low reliability.
2. **Green Button**: Negative reward, pressed 63 times. Reliable.
3. **Red Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. Low reliability.
4. **Yellow Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only twice. Low reliability.
5. **Purple Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. Low reliability.

From this analysis, we see that:
- The Green button has been pressed the most (63 times) and has a negative reward, but it is the only button with a reliable history. 
- All other buttons have extremely negative rewards and have been pressed very few times, indicating that their reliability is low and their performance is uncertain.

Since the Green button has the most data and is the most reliable option, despite its negative reward, it is still the best choice among the available options.

Therefore, I will choose the Green button next.

1. **Blue Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. Low reliability.
2. **Green Button**: Negative reward, pressed 74 times. Reliable.
3. **Red Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. Low reliability.
4. **Yellow Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only twice. Low reliability.
5. **Purple Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. Low reliability.

From this analysis, we see that:
- The blue, red, yellow, and purple buttons have all shown extremely negative rewards and have low reliability due to very few presses.
- The green button, while also negative, has been pressed 74 times, indicating that we have more data on its performance. 

Since the green button has the most data and is the least negative option, it is the most reliable choice among the buttons. 

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the green button.

1. **Blue Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. Low reliability.
2. **Green Button**: Negative reward, pressed 85 times. Reliable.
3. **Red Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. Low reliability.
4. **Yellow Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only twice. Low reliability.
5. **Purple Button**: Extremely negative reward, pressed only once. Low reliability.

From this analysis, we see that:
- The **Green button** has been pressed the most (85 times) and while it has a negative reward, it is the only button with a reliable history of rewards. The other buttons have been pressed very few times and have extremely negative rewards, indicating they are likely not worth pressing again.

Since the Green button has the most data and is the most reliable option, it is the best choice to maximize the total reward, even if the reward is negative.

Therefore, I will choose the Green button.
