1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 10 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the blue button is likely a good choice since it has consistently provided positive rewards.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the green button is not a good option based on the limited data.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. Similar to the green button, the red button also appears to be a poor choice based on its single negative outcome.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 0 times. We have no data on the yellow button, so we cannot assess its potential.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. Like the yellow button, we have no data on the purple button.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable option based on the available data. The other buttons either have negative outcomes or no data at all.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the blue button.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 37 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the blue button is likely a good choice since it has consistently provided positive rewards.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the green button is not a good option based on the limited data.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. Similar to the green button, the red button also appears to be a poor choice based on its single negative outcome.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 0 times. We have no data on the yellow button, so we cannot assess its potential.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. Like the yellow button, we have no data on the purple button.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the safest and most informed choice. The other buttons either have negative outcomes or no data at all.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the blue button.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 49 times.
   - Has a positive average reward.
   - This suggests that the blue button is likely the best option based on past performance.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time.
   - Has a negative average reward.
   - This indicates that the green button is not performing well.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time.
   - Has a negative average reward.
   - Similar to the green button, the red button is also not performing well.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times.
   - No information on its performance.
   - Since it hasn't been pressed, we have no data to suggest it is better or worse than the blue button.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times.
   - No information on its performance.
   - Like the yellow button, we have no data on its performance.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable choice based on the available data. The other buttons either have negative rewards or no data at all.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the blue button.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 71 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the blue button is likely a good choice since it has consistently provided positive rewards.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the green button is not a good option, as it has not performed well in the single trial.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. Similar to the green button, the red button has also performed poorly in its single trial.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. This indicates that the yellow button has potential, but it has only been tested once, so we have limited information about its reliability.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. Since this button has not been tested at all, we have no information about its performance.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the safest and most informed choice. The yellow button has potential but lacks sufficient data to make it a reliable choice compared to the blue button.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the blue button.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed only once with a negative average reward. This suggests that the green button is not a good choice, as it has not performed well in the single instance it was tested.

3. **Red Button**: Also pressed only once with a negative average reward. Similar to the green button, the red button has not shown promise based on its single test.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed once with a positive average reward. While this is a positive outcome, it is based on only one trial, making it less reliable than the blue button.

5. **Purple Button**: Not pressed at all. Since there is no data on the purple button, we cannot make an informed decision about its potential performance.

   - No information on its performance since it hasn't been tested yet.

Given that the blue button has a strong history of positive rewards and has been tested the most, it is a safe choice. The yellow button also has a positive reward but has only been tested once, making it less reliable than the blue button.

The green and red buttons have shown negative rewards, and the purple button has no data to support its performance.

Considering all of this, the best choice for maximizing the total reward is to continue pressing the blue button.

Thus, my final answer is:

97,blue,0,0,59,"You are a bandit algorithm in a room with 5 buttons labeled blue, red, green, yellow, purple. Each button is associated with a Bernoulli distribution with a fixed but unknown mean; the means for the buttons could be different. For each button, when you press it, you will get a reward that is sampled from the button's associated distribution. You have 100 time steps and, on each time step, you can choose any button and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps.

At each time step, I will show you a summary of your past choices and rewards. Then you must make the next choice, which must be exactly one of blue, red, green, yellow, purple.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 94 times with a positive average reward. This suggests that the blue button is likely a good choice since it has consistently provided positive rewards.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This indicates that the green button is not performing well, and it may not be a good choice.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. Similar to the green button, the red button has also performed poorly.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. This is a good sign, but since it has only been pressed once, we have very little information about its reliability.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. We have no information about the purple button since it hasn't been tried yet.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the safest and most informed choice. The yellow button has potential but lacks sufficient data to make it a reliable choice. The green and red buttons have shown negative performance, and the purple button is untested.

Considering all of this, the best choice for the next button press is the blue button.
