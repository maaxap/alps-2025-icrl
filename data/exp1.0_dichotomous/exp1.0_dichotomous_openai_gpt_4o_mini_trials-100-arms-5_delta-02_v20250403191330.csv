1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the blue button is not a good choice.
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. Similar to the blue button, this indicates that the green button is also not a good choice.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. Again, this suggests that the red button is not a good option.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This indicates that the yellow button is also not favorable.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 34 times with a positive average reward. This is the only button that has shown a positive average reward, indicating that it is likely the best option among the choices.

Given that the purple button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most promising choice for maximizing total reward.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the purple button.

Given that the purple button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most promising choice for maximizing total reward.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the purple button.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. Similar to the blue button, this indicates that the green button is also likely not a good choice.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. Again, this suggests that the red button is not a good option.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This button also appears to be a poor choice.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 83 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the purple button has consistently provided positive rewards and is likely the best option.

Since the purple button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most promising choice. The other buttons have only been pressed once and have negative average rewards, which makes them less favorable.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the purple button.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the blue button is likely not a good choice.
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. Similar to the blue button, this indicates that the green button is also likely not a good choice.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. Again, this suggests that the red button is not a good option.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This indicates that the yellow button is also likely not a good choice.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 95 times with a positive average reward. This is a strong indicator that the purple button is the best option, as it has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward.

Given that the purple button has shown a positive average reward over a significant number of trials, it is the most promising choice for maximizing total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the purple button for the next press.
