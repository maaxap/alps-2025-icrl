3. **Red Button**: Pressed 23 times, positive average reward. This button has been tested extensively and has shown to yield positive rewards, making it a strong candidate for the next choice.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, positive average reward. While it has a positive reward, it has only been tested once, so we don't have enough data to confidently choose it over the red button.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. This button has not been tested at all, so we have no information about its performance.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, negative average reward. This suggests that the blue button is likely not a good choice.
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time, negative average reward. Similar to the blue button, this indicates that the green button is also likely not a good choice.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 49 times, positive average reward. This is a strong indicator that the red button is performing well and is likely the best option based on past performance.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, positive average reward. While this is a good sign, the limited number of trials (only 1) makes it less reliable than the red button.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. Since there is no data on the purple button, we cannot make an informed decision about its performance.

Given that the red button has been pressed the most times and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable choice based on the data we have.

Therefore, I will choose the red button for the next press.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, negative average reward. This suggests that this button is not a good choice.
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time, negative average reward. Similar to the blue button, this is also not a good choice.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 61 times, positive average reward. This button has been tested extensively and has shown to yield positive rewards, making it a strong candidate for the next choice.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, positive average reward. While it has a positive average reward, it has only been pressed once, so we don't have enough data to confidently choose it over the red button.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. This button has not been tested at all, so we have no information about its performance.

Given that the red button has been pressed the most times and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable option based on the data we have.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that this button is not a good choice.
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. Similar to the blue button, this is also not a good choice.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 73 times with a positive average reward. This button has been tested the most and has shown to yield positive rewards, making it a strong candidate for the next choice.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. While it has a positive reward, it has only been tested once, so we don't have enough data to confidently choose it over the red button.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. This button has not been tested at all, so we have no information about its performance.

Given that the red button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable option based on the data we have.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, negative average reward. This suggests that this button is likely not a good choice.
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time, negative average reward. Similar to the blue button, this is also likely not a good choice.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 86 times, positive average reward. This button has been tested extensively and has shown to yield positive rewards, making it a strong candidate for the next choice.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, positive average reward. While it has a positive average reward, it has only been tested once, so we don't have enough data to confidently choose it over the red button.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. This button has not been tested at all, so we have no information about its performance.
