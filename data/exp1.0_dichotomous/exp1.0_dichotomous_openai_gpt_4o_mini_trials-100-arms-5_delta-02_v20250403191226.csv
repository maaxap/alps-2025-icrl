2. **Green Button**: Pressed 2 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the green button has performed well so far, making it a strong candidate for the next choice.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 0 times. Since it hasn't been tried yet, we have no information about its performance. However, it could potentially be a good option.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the blue button is likely not a good choice since it has yielded negative rewards.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 12 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the green button has been performing well and is likely the best option based on past performance.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 0 times. We have no information about the red button's performance, but since it hasn't been pressed, we cannot assume it will perform well.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 0 times. Similar to the red button, we have no information about its performance.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. Again, we have no information about its performance.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 0 times. Similar to the red button, we have no information about its performance.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. Again, we have no information about its performance.

Given that the green button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable choice based on the data we have. The other buttons either have negative performance (blue) or no data at all (red, yellow, purple).

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the green button.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the blue button is likely not a good choice since it has yielded negative rewards.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 38 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the green button is performing well and is likely the best option based on the data we have.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 0 times. We have no information about the red button's performance, but since it hasn't been pressed at all, we cannot assume it will perform well.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 0 times. Similar to the red button, we have no information about its performance.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. Again, we have no information about its performance.

Given that the green button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable choice based on the data we have. The other buttons either have negative performance (blue) or no data at all (red, yellow, purple).

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the green button.

- The green button has been pressed 65 times and has a positive average reward, suggesting it is a strong candidate for maximizing rewards.
- The red, yellow, and purple buttons have not been pressed at all, meaning we have no information about their potential rewards.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the blue button is not a good choice since it has yielded a negative outcome.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 67 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the green button is performing well and is likely the best option based on past performance.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 0 times. We have no information about the red button's performance, but since it hasn't been pressed at all, we cannot assume it will perform well.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 0 times. Similar to the red button, we have no data on its performance.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the blue button is likely not a good choice since it has yielded negative rewards.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 79 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the green button has been consistently yielding positive rewards, making it a strong candidate for the next choice.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 0 times. We have no information about the red button's performance since it hasn't been tried yet.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 0 times. Similar to the red button, we have no information about the yellow button.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. Again, we have no information about the purple button.

Given that the green button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable option based on the data we have. The other buttons (red, yellow, purple) have not been tested, and the blue button has shown negative performance.

Which button will you choose next? Remember, YOU MUST provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>COLOR</Answer> where COLOR is one of blue, green, red, yellow, purple. Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","Based on the summary of past choices and rewards:

- The blue button has been pressed once and has a negative average reward, indicating it is likely not a good choice.
- The green button has been pressed 92 times and has a positive average reward, suggesting it is a strong candidate for maximizing rewards.
- The red, yellow, and purple buttons have not been pressed at all, meaning we have no information about their potential rewards.

Given that the green button has a high positive average reward from a significant number of trials, it is the most reliable option. The other buttons (red, yellow, purple) have not been tested, and the blue button has shown to be detrimental.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the green button.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This indicates that pressing the blue button is likely not a good choice since it has resulted in a negative outcome.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 93 times with a positive average reward. This suggests that the green button is performing well and is likely the best option based on the data we have.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 0 times. We have no information about the red button's performance, but since it hasn't been pressed at all, we cannot assume it will perform well.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 0 times. Similar to the red button, we have no data on its performance.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. Again, no data on its performance.

Given that the green button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable choice based on the available data. The other buttons either have negative performance (blue) or no data at all (red, yellow, purple).

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the green button.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the blue button is likely not a good choice since it has yielded a negative reward.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 94 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the green button has been the most successful choice so far, yielding positive rewards consistently.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 0 times. We have no information about the red button's performance since it hasn't been tried yet.
