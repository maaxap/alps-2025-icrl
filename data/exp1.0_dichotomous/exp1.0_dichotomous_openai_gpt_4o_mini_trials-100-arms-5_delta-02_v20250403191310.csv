1. **Blue, Green, and Purple buttons** have all resulted in negative average rewards, indicating they are likely not good choices.
2. **Red button** has been pressed the most (8 times) and has a positive average reward, suggesting it is a strong candidate for maximizing future rewards.
3. **Yellow button** has a positive average reward but has only been pressed once, making it less reliable than the red button, which has more data supporting its performance.

Given that the red button has the most positive feedback and has been tested significantly more than the yellow button, it is the best choice for maximizing rewards in the next time step.

Therefore, I will choose the red button.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time, negative average reward. This button is also not a good choice.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 47 times, positive average reward. This button has been the most frequently pressed and has yielded positive results, making it a strong candidate.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, positive average reward. While it has a positive reward, it has only been pressed once, so we don't have enough data to confidently choose it over the red button.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time, negative average reward. This button is not a good choice.

Given that the red button has been pressed the most times and has a positive average reward, it is the best option based on the available data.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 85 times, positive average reward. This button has been the most successful choice so far.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time, negative average reward. This button is not a good choice.

Given that the red button has been pressed the most times and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable option based on the data we have. The yellow button, while also positive, lacks sufficient data to make it a strong contender.
