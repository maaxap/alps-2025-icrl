1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 8 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the blue button is likely a good choice since it has been tested the most and has yielded positive results.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Although it has a positive reward, it has only been pressed once, so we have very little information about its reliability.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Similar to the green button, it has only been pressed once, making it hard to assess its true potential.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Like the green and red buttons, it has limited data.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This button has shown to be less favorable based on the single trial.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable option based on the data we have. The other buttons have either been pressed very few times or have shown negative results.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the blue button.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Similar to the green button, it has only been tested once, making it less reliable.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Like the green and red buttons, it has only been tested once.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To make a good choice for the next button to press, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 19 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the blue button is likely a good choice since it has been tested extensively and has yielded positive results.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Although it has a positive reward, it has only been pressed once, so we have very little information about its reliability.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Similar to the green button, it has only been pressed once, making it hard to assess its true potential.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Like the green and red buttons, it has limited data.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This button has shown a negative outcome, suggesting it is not a good choice.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most times and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable option based on the data we have. The other buttons (green, red, yellow) have not been tested enough to confidently choose them over the blue button.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the blue button.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed only 1 time with a positive average reward. While this is promising, the sample size is too small to draw any strong conclusions about its performance.

3. **Red Button**: Similar to the green button, it has been pressed only 1 time with a positive average reward. Again, the sample size is too small to make a confident decision.

4. **Yellow Button**: Also pressed only 1 time with a positive average reward. Like the green and red buttons, it lacks sufficient data.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 42 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the blue button is likely the best option since it has been tested extensively and has shown consistent positive results.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed only 1 time with a positive average reward. While it has a positive reward, the sample size is too small to draw any reliable conclusions about its performance.

3. **Red Button**: Similar to the green button, it has been pressed only 1 time with a positive average reward. Again, the sample size is too small.

4. **Yellow Button**: Also pressed only 1 time with a positive average reward. Like the green and red buttons, it lacks sufficient data.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This indicates that the purple button is likely not a good choice, as it has shown a negative outcome.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable choice based on the data available. The other buttons (green, red, yellow) have not been tested enough to make a confident decision, and the purple button has shown negative results.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 53 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the blue button is likely the best option since it has been tested extensively and has shown consistent positive results.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed only 1 time with a positive average reward. While it has a positive reward, the sample size is too small to draw any reliable conclusions about its performance.

3. **Red Button**: Also pressed only 1 time with a positive average reward. Similar to the green button, the sample size is too small to be confident in its effectiveness.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Again, the small sample size makes it difficult to assess its true potential.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the purple button is likely not a good choice, as it has shown a negative outcome.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable option based on the data available. The other buttons either have insufficient data or have shown negative results.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the blue button.

Since we have 100 time steps and still have many opportunities to explore, it might be beneficial to explore one of the less pressed buttons. However, given that the blue button has a strong positive average reward and has been tested extensively, it is a reliable choice.

Considering the balance between exploration and exploitation, I will choose the blue button for the next step.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable choice based on the data we have. The other buttons (green, red, yellow) have only been pressed once, so we have no certainty about their performance compared to the blue button.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the blue button.

   - This button has been tested extensively, and it seems to be a reliable choice.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Positive average reward
   - Very limited data, but it has shown a positive reward.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Positive average reward
   - Similar to the green button, it has limited data but also a positive reward.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Positive average reward
   - Again, limited data but a positive reward.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Negative average reward
   - This button has shown a negative reward, indicating it is likely not a good choice.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable option based on the data. The other buttons (green, red, yellow) have only been pressed once, so we don't have enough information to confidently choose them over the blue button.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To decide which button to press next, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 87 times
   - Has a positive average reward
   - This button has been tested extensively, and since it has a positive average reward, it is likely to yield a good reward.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Has a positive average reward
   - This button has only been tested once, so we have very little information about its true mean. However, the single positive reward is promising.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Has a positive average reward
   - Similar to the green button, it has only been tested once, but the positive reward is encouraging.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Has a positive average reward
   - Again, like the green and red buttons, it has only been tested once, but the positive reward is a good sign.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Has a negative average reward
   - This button has been tested once and yielded a negative reward, indicating it is likely not a good choice.

Given that the blue button has been tested the most and has a positive average reward, it is the safest choice. The other buttons (green, red, yellow) have only been tested once, and while they have positive rewards, we cannot be certain of their reliability due to the lack of data.

Therefore, I will choose the blue button for the next press.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed only 1 time with a positive average reward. While it has a positive reward, the sample size is too small to draw any strong conclusions about its performance.

3. **Red Button**: Also pressed only 1 time with a positive average reward. Similar to the green button, the sample size is too small to be confident in its effectiveness.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Again, the small sample size makes it hard to assess its reliability.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This button has shown to be ineffective based on the single trial.
