1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 9 times with a positive average reward. This suggests that the blue button is likely a good choice since it has been tested multiple times and has shown consistent positive results.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Although it has a positive average reward, it has only been tested once, which means we have very little information about its reliability.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Similar to the green button, it has only been tested once, so we cannot be confident in its performance.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This indicates that the yellow button is likely not a good choice, as it has shown a negative outcome.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. We have no information about the purple button since it hasn't been tested at all.

Given this analysis, the blue button has the most data supporting its positive performance, having been pressed 9 times. The other buttons either have insufficient data or negative results.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the blue button.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To decide which button to press next, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 32 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the blue button is likely a good choice since it has been tested extensively and has yielded positive results.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed only 1 time with a positive average reward. While it has a positive reward, the sample size is too small to draw any strong conclusions about its effectiveness.

3. **Red Button**: Also pressed only 1 time with a positive average reward. Similar to the green button, the sample size is too small to make a reliable decision.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the yellow button is not a good choice, as it has yielded a negative reward.

5. **Purple Button**: Not pressed at all. Since there is no data on the purple button, we cannot assess its potential.

Given this analysis, the blue button has the most data supporting its effectiveness, while the other buttons (green, red, yellow, and purple) either have insufficient data or negative results. Therefore, the best choice for maximizing the total reward is to continue pressing the blue button.

Thus, I will choose the blue button next.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 44 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the blue button is likely a good choice since it has been tested extensively and has yielded positive results.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Although it has a positive reward, it has only been pressed once, so we have very little information about its reliability.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Similar to the green button, it has only been pressed once, providing limited information.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the yellow button is not a good choice, as it has yielded a negative reward.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. We have no information about this button since it has not been tested at all.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has a positive average reward, it is the most reliable option based on the data we have. The other buttons either have limited data or negative results.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 66 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the blue button is likely a good choice since it has been tested extensively and has yielded positive results.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 2 times with a positive average reward. Although it has a positive average reward, it has been tested very few times, making it less reliable than the blue button.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. Similar to the green button, it has been tested very little, so we cannot draw strong conclusions about its performance.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the yellow button is likely not a good choice, as it has already shown a negative outcome.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. Since it has not been tested at all, we have no information about its performance. However, it could potentially be a good option since it hasn't been negatively impacted by previous choices.

Given that the blue button has the most data and a positive average reward, it is the safest and most informed choice. The green button, while also positive, has insufficient data to be considered a better option than blue.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the blue button.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 76 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that the blue button is likely a good choice since it has been tested extensively and has yielded positive results.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 3 times with a positive average reward. Although it has a positive average reward, it has been tested very few times, making it less reliable than the blue button.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. This is not enough data to make a confident decision about its effectiveness.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This suggests that the yellow button is likely not a good choice.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. Since there is no data on the purple button, we cannot assess its potential.

Given that the blue button has the most data and a positive average reward, it is the safest and most logical choice to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the blue button.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 81 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that it is likely a good option, but since it has been pressed so many times, the potential for discovering a better option may be limited.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 3 times with a positive average reward. This suggests that it might also be a good option, but we have very little data on it. It could potentially have a higher mean reward than the blue button, but we need more exploration.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with a positive average reward. This is very limited data, but it shows potential. However, the uncertainty is high due to the lack of trials.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This indicates that it is likely not a good option, so we should avoid it.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. This button has not been explored at all, so we have no information about its potential. However, it could be a hidden gem.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 83 times with a positive average reward. This indicates that it is likely a good option, but it has been explored extensively already.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 7 times with a positive average reward. This button has not been pressed as much as blue, but it still shows promise.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed only 1 time with a positive average reward. This button has been explored very little, but the single positive reward suggests it might be worth exploring further.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time with a negative average reward. This button is likely not a good choice since it has shown a negative outcome.

5. **Purple Button**: Not pressed at all. This button has not been explored yet, so we have no information about its potential.

Given that we have 8 time steps left and the blue button has been pressed the most, it might be beneficial to explore the less pressed buttons to gather more information and potentially find a better option.

Considering the options:
- The green button has a positive average reward and has been pressed more than the red and purple buttons.
- The red button has only been pressed once, but it also has a positive average reward.
- The purple button has not been pressed at all, so it could be a wild card.

Since we want to maximize our total reward and also explore options that have not been fully evaluated, I will choose the **purple button** for this next step.
