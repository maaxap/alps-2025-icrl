- The **green button** has been pressed the most (31 times) and has the highest average reward (0.3548). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on the data we have.
- The other buttons (blue, red, yellow, purple) have not yielded any rewards, as their average rewards are all 0.0.

Given that the green button has shown a positive average reward and has been tested extensively, it is reasonable to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **green button** has been pressed the most (54 times) and has the highest average reward (0.37). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on past performance.
- The other buttons (blue, red, yellow, purple) have not yielded any rewards, as their average rewards are all 0.0.

For each button, when you press it, you will get a reward that is sampled from the button's associated distribution. You have 100 time steps and, on each time step, you can choose any button and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.0
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 89 times, average reward = 0.3258426966292135
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **green button** has been pressed the most (89 times) and has the highest average reward (0.3258). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on past performance.
- The other buttons (blue, red, yellow, purple) have all been pressed very few times and have an average reward of 0.0, indicating they have not provided any positive rewards in the limited trials.

Given that the green button has a significantly higher average reward and has been tested extensively, it is reasonable to continue pressing the green button to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, my choice for the next button to press is:
