Given that the blue button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it is a strong candidate for maximizing the total reward. The other buttons (green, red, yellow) have not shown any positive results, and the purple button has not been tested at all.

Since we want to maximize our reward and the blue button has proven to be the best option so far, I will choose to press the blue button again.

The other buttons have not provided any positive rewards and have only been pressed once, which does not give us enough information to make a confident choice.

The other buttons (green, red, yellow, and purple) have only been pressed once each and have an average reward of 0.0.

Given that the blue button has a significantly higher average reward and has been tested extensively, it is the most reliable choice at this point. The other buttons have not provided any positive rewards, and pressing them again would not be a strategic move.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the blue button.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. Like the others, it has not been explored much.

Given that the blue button has the highest average reward, it seems like a safe choice. However, since the other buttons have only been pressed once and have not yielded any rewards, it might be beneficial to explore one of them to gather more information about their potential.

Since the blue button has already been pressed a lot and has a good average reward, I will choose to explore one of the less pressed buttons. Among the green, red, yellow, and purple buttons, I will choose the green button, as it is the first one in the list of less pressed buttons.

Exploring the green button could provide new information about its reward distribution.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 74 times
   - Average reward: 0.5135
   - This button has been tested extensively and has a decent average reward.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Very limited data, but the average reward is currently 0.0.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Also very limited data with a reward of 0.0.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Limited data with a reward of 0.0.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Limited data with a reward of 0.0.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has the highest average reward, it is the most reliable choice based on the available data. The other buttons have not provided any positive rewards and have very limited data, making them less favorable options.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the blue button.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 75 times with an average reward of approximately 0.51. This is the highest average reward among all buttons, indicating that it is likely the best option so far.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.0. This suggests that it has not provided any reward in the limited trials.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. Similar to the green button, it has not yielded any reward.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. Again, no reward has been received.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. Like the others, it has not provided any reward.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has the highest average reward, it is the most promising option. The other buttons have not shown any positive results, and since we have only 20 time steps left, it would be prudent to continue pressing the blue button to maximize the total reward.

From this summary, we can see that the blue button has been pressed the most and has the highest average reward. The other buttons (green, red, yellow, purple) have only been pressed a few times and have not yielded any rewards.

Given that the blue button has a significantly higher average reward compared to the others, it is reasonable to continue pressing the blue button to maximize the total reward.
