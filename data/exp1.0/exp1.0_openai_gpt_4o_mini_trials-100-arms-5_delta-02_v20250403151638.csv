1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 19 times
   - Average reward: 0.5263
   - This button has been tested extensively and has a decent average reward.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Very limited data; not promising based on one trial.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Similar to green, very limited data and not promising.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Again, very limited data and not promising.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Like the others, very limited data and not promising.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has the highest average reward, it is the most reliable option based on the data we have. The other buttons have not shown any positive reward yet, and pressing them again would not provide useful information due to their limited trials.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the blue button.

1. **Blue Button**:

   - Average reward: 0.525
   - This button has been tested the most and has a relatively high average reward.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Very few trials, and the average reward is low.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Only one trial, and the average reward is low.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Only one trial, and the average reward is low.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Only one trial, and the average reward is low.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has the highest average reward, it is the most promising option based on the data we have. The other buttons have not been tested enough to draw any meaningful conclusions, and they all have a reward of 0.0 from very few trials.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the blue button.

Given that the blue button has a relatively high average reward compared to the others, it seems to be the best option based on the data we have. The other buttons have not shown any positive reward, and pressing them again may not be beneficial at this time.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 94 times
   - Average reward: 0.4255
   - This button has been tested extensively and has a decent average reward.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Very limited data, but currently shows no reward.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Also very limited data with no reward.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Limited data with no reward.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Limited data with no reward.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has the highest average reward, it is the most reliable option based on the data we have. The other buttons have not provided any positive rewards and have very limited data, making them less favorable choices.

Since we want to maximize the total reward, the best choice is to continue pressing the blue button.

Thus, my final answer is:

<Answer>blue</Answer>",red,41,0,0,0,0,95,1,2,1,1,13
