1. **Blue Button**:

   - Not promising since it has only been pressed once and yielded no reward.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 22 times, average reward = 0.36363636363636365
   - This button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, indicating it is likely a good choice.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - Similar to the blue button, it has not shown any promise.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times
   - We have no information about this button, so we cannot assess its potential.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times
   - Like the yellow button, we have no information about this button.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it is the most reliable option based on the data we have. 

Therefore, I will choose the green button for the next press.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **green button** has been pressed the most (32 times) and has the highest average reward (0.375). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on past performance.
- The **blue**, **red**, and **yellow buttons** have all been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, indicating they have not been successful in yielding rewards.
- The **purple button** has not been pressed at all, so we have no information about its potential.

Given that the green button has shown a positive average reward and has been tested extensively, it is reasonable to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, my choice for the next button to press is the green button.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times (not yet explored)

Given that the green button has the highest average reward, it seems to be the best option based on the data we have. However, we also have the purple button that has not been explored at all. 

Since we have 100 time steps and have already pressed the green button 33 times, it might be beneficial to explore the purple button to gather more information about its potential rewards. 

However, since the green button has shown a consistent reward, it would be wise to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward. 

Therefore, I will choose the green button again for the next time step.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","Based on the summary of past choices and rewards, we can analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0. This button has not yielded any reward so far.
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 44 times, average reward = 0.3636. This button has been the most frequently pressed and has a decent average reward.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0. Similar to the blue button, it has not yielded any reward.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0. Like the blue and red buttons, it has not yielded any reward.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. This button has not been tested at all.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward, it would be logical to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward. However, since the purple button has not been pressed at all, it might be worth exploring it to see if it could yield a better reward than the current average of the green button.

Considering the balance between exploration (trying the purple button) and exploitation (continuing with the green button), I will choose to press the green button again since it has already shown a positive average reward.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that the green button has been pressed the most (67 times) and has the highest average reward (approximately 0.403). The other buttons (blue, red, yellow) have all been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, indicating they are not performing well.

The purple button has not been pressed at all, so we have no information about its performance. However, given that the green button has a significantly higher average reward, it is a strong candidate for maximizing our total reward.

Since we have 30 time steps left and the green button has shown to be the best option so far, it makes sense to continue pressing the green button to maximize our expected reward.

From this summary, we can see that the green button has been pressed the most (79 times) and has the highest average reward (0.3924). The other buttons (blue, red, yellow) have all yielded an average reward of 0.0, indicating they are not performing well.

The purple button has not been pressed at all, which means we have no information about its potential reward. However, given that the green button has a significantly higher average reward, it is a safer choice to continue pressing it rather than exploring the purple button, which has no data.

Since we have 100 time steps and have already pressed the green button 79 times, we can afford to continue pressing it to maximize our total reward.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 90 times, average reward = 0.3889
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that the green button has been pressed the most (90 times) and has the highest average reward (0.3889). The other buttons (blue, red, yellow) have all been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, indicating they have not been successful in yielding rewards.

The purple button has not been pressed at all, which means we have no information about its potential reward. However, given that the green button has a significantly higher average reward, it is a safer choice to continue pressing it.

Since the goal is to maximize the total reward, I will choose the green button again.

Given that we have only one time step left, we should consider the following:

- The green button has a proven track record of providing a reward (0.3958), which is significantly better than the other buttons.
- The purple button has not been tested, but since we have a strong candidate in the green button, it would be risky to switch to an untested button at this point.
