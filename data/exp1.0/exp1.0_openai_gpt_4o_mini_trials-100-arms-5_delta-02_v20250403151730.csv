From this summary, we can see that:

- The yellow button has the highest average reward (0.3469) and has been pressed the most (49 times). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on the data we have.
- The blue button has a decent average reward (0.25) but has been pressed significantly fewer times (4 times).

From this summary, we can see that:

- The yellow button has the highest average reward (0.3667) and has been pressed the most (60 times). This suggests that it is likely a good choice since it has a significant amount of data supporting its average.
- The blue button has a decent average reward (0.25) but has been pressed much less frequently (4 times).
- The green, red, and purple buttons have not shown any positive rewards yet, with averages of 0.0.

   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 82 times, average reward = 0.3780487804878049
   - This button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most times, indicating it is likely the best option based on past performance.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - Like the green and red buttons, it has not yielded any reward.
