1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 5 times, average reward = 0.4
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 0 times, average reward = unknown
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times, average reward = unknown

From the data:
- The red button has the highest average reward (0.4) among the buttons that have been pressed.
- The green button has a decent average reward (0.3333), but it is lower than the red button.
- The blue button has not performed well (0.0).
- The yellow and purple buttons have not been tested at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

Given that the red button has the highest average reward, it would be a reasonable choice to maximize the total reward. However, since the yellow and purple buttons have not been pressed, there is a possibility that one of them could yield a higher reward than the red button. 

Since we have limited time steps (100) and we want to maximize our reward, it might be beneficial to explore the yellow and purple buttons to gather more information about their potential rewards. 

However, given the current data, the red button is the best option based on the average reward observed so far.

Therefore, I will choose the red button for the next press.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 0 times
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times

From the summary, we can see that both the green and red buttons have the same average reward of 0.3333, which is better than the blue button's average reward of 0.0. The yellow and purple buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

Since we want to maximize our total reward, we should consider the following:

- The green and red buttons have shown some positive reward, so they are good candidates to continue pressing.
- The yellow and purple buttons have not been explored yet, and pressing them could potentially yield better rewards, but we have no data to support that.

Given that the green and red buttons have already provided a consistent reward, it might be wise to continue pressing one of them. However, since we have pressed both the green and red buttons the same number of times and they have the same average reward, we can choose either of them.

To introduce some exploration, I will choose to press the yellow button, which has not been pressed at all. This will allow us to gather new information about its potential reward.

Thus, my choice for the next button to press is:

- The **blue button** has not yielded any reward and has only been pressed once, so it may not be worth pressing again.
- The **green** and **red buttons** have the same average reward (0.3333), but they have been pressed multiple times, indicating that they may not be as promising as the yellow button.

Given that the yellow button has shown a high reward in its single trial, it would be a good strategy to press it again to confirm if it consistently yields high rewards.

   - Pressed 9 times, average reward = 0.7778
   - This button has the highest average reward among the options, making it a strong candidate.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times, so we have no information about its average reward.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To decide which button to press next, let's analyze the data provided:

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - Not a good choice since it has only been pressed once and yielded no reward.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333
   - This button has a low average reward compared to others.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333
   - Similar to the green button, it has a low average reward.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 20 times, average reward = 0.75
   - This button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most. It seems to be the best option based on the data.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times
   - We have no information about this button since it hasn't been pressed at all.

Given that the yellow button has the highest average reward, it would be the most logical choice to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button next.

1. **Blue Button**:

   - Not a good choice since it has a low average reward.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 31 times, average reward = 0.7097
   - This button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most. It seems to be the best option based on the data.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times, no data available.
   - Since we have no information about this button, it is risky to choose it.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - Not a good choice since it has a low average reward.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333
   - This is a moderate reward, but not the highest.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333
   - Similar to the green button, it has a moderate reward.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 52 times, average reward = 0.6731
   - This button has the highest average reward, making it the best option based on past performance.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times, so we have no information about its reward potential.

Given that the yellow button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most times, it is the most reliable choice based on the data we have.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button next.

   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333
   - This button has a low average reward and a small sample size.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333
   - Similar to the green button, it has a low average reward and a small sample size.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 62 times, average reward = 0.6774
   - This button has the highest average reward and a large sample size, indicating it is likely the best option.

5. **Purple Button**:

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333

   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333
   - This button has a low average reward and a limited number of trials.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333
   - Similar to the green button, it has a low average reward and limited trials.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 83 times, average reward = 0.6867
   - This button has the highest average reward and a significant number of trials, indicating it is likely the best option.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times
   - No data available, but since it hasn't been pressed at all, we have no information about its potential.

Given that the yellow button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is the most promising option. 

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button for the next press.

Each button is associated with a Bernoulli distribution with a fixed but unknown mean; the means for the buttons could be different. For each button, when you press it, you will get a reward that is sampled from the button's associated distribution. You have 100 time steps and, on each time step, you can choose any button and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - Not a good choice since it has a low average reward.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333
   - This is a moderate average reward, but not very high.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.3333
   - Similar to the green button, it has a moderate average reward.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 84 times, average reward = 0.6905
   - This button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most. It seems to be the best option based on the data.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 0 times, no data available.
   - Since it has not been pressed at all, we have no information about its potential reward.

Given that the yellow button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most times, it is the most reliable choice. 

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button next.
