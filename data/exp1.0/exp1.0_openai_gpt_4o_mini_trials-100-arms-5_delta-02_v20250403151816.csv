4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.67
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 1.0

Now, let's evaluate the average rewards:

- The **blue button** has a solid average reward of 0.75, based on 4 trials.
- The **green button** has a very low average reward of 0.0, but it has only been pressed once, so it may not be a good choice.
- The **red button** has an average reward of 0.5, which is lower than blue and yellow.
- The **yellow button** has an average reward of 0.67, which is decent but lower than blue.
- The **purple button** has the highest average reward of 1.0, but it has only been pressed once, so it may not be fully reliable yet.

Given that the purple button has the highest average reward but limited data, it might be worth exploring further. However, the blue button has a good balance of a high average reward and more data points, making it a safer choice.

Considering the exploration-exploitation trade-off, I will choose the purple button to see if it can maintain its high average reward.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.5

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 11 times, average reward = 0.7272727272727273

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **yellow button** has the highest average reward (approximately 0.727) and has been pressed the most times (11). This suggests that it is likely a good choice since it has a higher average reward compared to the others.
  
- The **blue**, **red**, and **purple buttons** all have the same average reward of 0.5, but they have been pressed fewer times than the yellow button.

- The **green button** has the lowest average reward (0.0) and has only been pressed once, indicating it is not a good choice.

Given that the yellow button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it is reasonable to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button next.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

3. **Red Button**:

From this summary, we can see that the yellow button has the highest average reward (0.75) and has been pressed the most times (12). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on the data we have.

The other buttons (blue, red, and purple) have lower average rewards, and the green button has not provided any reward yet.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 21 times, average reward = 0.619 (highest average reward)

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5

From this summary, the yellow button has the highest average reward (0.619) and has been pressed the most times (21). This suggests that it is likely the best option to continue pressing, as it has shown consistent performance.

The other buttons (blue, red, and purple) have lower average rewards, and the green button has a very low average reward from only one press.

Given this analysis, the best choice for the next button press is the yellow button.

   - This button has a moderate average reward but has been pressed relatively few times.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - This button has a very low average reward, and since it has only been pressed once, it may not be a good choice.

3. **Red Button**:

4. **Yellow Button**:

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

3. **Red Button**:

   - Pressed 32 times, average reward = 0.65625

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **yellow button** has the highest average reward (0.65625) and has been pressed the most times (32). This suggests that it is likely a good choice since it has a higher average reward compared to the others.
- The **blue**, **red**, and **purple buttons** all have the same average reward of 0.5, but they have been pressed fewer times, which means we have less confidence in their average rewards.
- The **green button** has the lowest average reward (0.0) and has only been pressed once, indicating it is likely not a good choice.

Given that the yellow button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it is reasonable to choose it again to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button next.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.5
   - This button has a moderate average reward but has been pressed relatively few times.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - This button has a very low average reward and has only been pressed once, indicating it may not be a good choice.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
   - Similar to the blue button, it has a moderate average reward but has also been pressed very few times.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 42 times, average reward = 0.6904761904761905
   - This button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most times, indicating it is likely the best option based on past performance.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
   - Like the blue and red buttons, it has a moderate average reward but has been pressed very few times.

Given that the yellow button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is the most reliable choice.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

   - Similar to the blue button, it has a moderate average reward but has also been pressed few times.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 63 times, average reward = 0.6984
   - This button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most times, indicating it is likely the best option based on past performance.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5

   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.5
   - This button has a moderate average reward but has been pressed relatively few times.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - This button has a very low average reward and has been pressed only once, indicating it may not be a good choice.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
   - Similar to the blue button, it has a moderate average reward but has also been pressed very few times.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 73 times, average reward = 0.6575342465753424
   - This button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most times, indicating it is likely the best option based on past performance.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
   - Like the blue and red buttons, it has a moderate average reward but has been pressed very few times.

Each button is associated with a Bernoulli distribution with a fixed but unknown mean; the means for the buttons could be different. For each button, when you press it, you will get a reward that is sampled from the button's associated distribution. You have 100 time steps and, on each time step, you can choose any button and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps.

At each time step, I will show you a summary of your past choices and rewards. Then you must make the next choice, which must be exactly one of blue, red, green, yellow, purple.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.5
   - This button has a moderate average reward but has been pressed relatively few times.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - This button has a very low average reward, and since it has only been pressed once, it is not a good candidate.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
   - Similar to the blue button, it has a moderate average reward but has also been pressed very few times.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 84 times, average reward = 0.6547619047619048
   - This button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most times, indicating it is likely the best option based on past performance.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
   - Like the blue and red buttons, it has a moderate average reward but has been pressed very few times.

Given that the yellow button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is the most reliable choice. 

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button for the next press.
