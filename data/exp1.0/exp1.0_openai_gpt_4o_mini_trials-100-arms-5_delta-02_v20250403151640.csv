5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that the green button has been pressed the most (32 times) and has the highest average reward (0.5). The other buttons (blue, red, yellow) have all been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, indicating they are not performing well.

The purple button has not been pressed at all, so we have no information about its performance. However, given that the green button has shown a positive average reward, it is a strong candidate for maximizing our total reward.

Since we have 100 time steps and the green button has already demonstrated a good average reward, it makes sense to continue pressing the green button to maximize our total reward.

Therefore, my choice for the next button to press is:

The purple button has not been pressed at all, so we have no information about its performance. However, given that the green button has a significantly higher average reward, it makes sense to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","Based on the summary of past choices and rewards, we can analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0. This button has not provided any reward so far.
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 67 times, average reward = 0.6119402985074627. This button has been the most frequently pressed and has a decent average reward.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0. Similar to the blue button, it has not provided any reward.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0. Like the blue and red buttons, it has not yielded any reward.
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times. This button has not been tested at all.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it seems to be the best option based on the available data. The other buttons either have not been tested or have not provided any rewards.

However, since we have 30 time steps left, it might also be worth exploring the purple button, which has not been pressed at all. This could potentially yield a better reward if its mean is higher than the green button's average.

Considering the current data, I will choose to press the green button again, as it has proven to be the most rewarding option so far.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that the green button has been pressed the most (90 times) and has the highest average reward (0.6). The other buttons (blue, red, yellow) have all been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, indicating they are not performing well.

The purple button has not been pressed at all, so we have no information about its performance. However, given that the green button has a significantly higher average reward, it is a safer choice to continue pressing it.

Since we have 100 time steps and have already pressed the green button 90 times, we can press it 7 more times to maximize our total reward.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the green button.

The other buttons (blue, red, yellow) have all been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, indicating they have not been successful in yielding rewards.

The purple button has not been pressed at all, which means we have no information about its potential reward. However, given that the green button has a significantly higher average reward, it would be prudent to continue pressing the green button to maximize the total reward.

Since the green button has shown to be the best option based on the data, I will choose it again.
