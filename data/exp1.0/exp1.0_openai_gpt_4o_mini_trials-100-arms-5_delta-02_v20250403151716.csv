3. **Red Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is a moderate reward, but it is significantly lower than the blue button.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. Similar to the red button, this is also a moderate reward but still lower than the blue button.

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. Like the green button, this has not performed well and is not a reliable choice.

   - Very limited data, but the single trial resulted in no reward. Not a promising option.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times
   - Average reward: 0.5
   - Moderate average reward, but not as high as the blue button. Limited data.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times
   - Average reward: 0.5
   - Similar to the red button, with limited data and a moderate average reward.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Like the green button, it has very limited data and resulted in no reward.

Given this analysis, the blue button stands out as the best option based on its high average reward and the number of times it has been pressed. The other buttons either have low average rewards or insufficient data to make a confident choice.

   - This button has been tested extensively and has the highest average reward.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Very limited data, but the single reward was 0.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times
   - Average reward: 0.5
   - Limited data, but better than green and purple.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times
   - Average reward: 0.5
   - Similar to red, limited data.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Like green, very limited data and the single reward was 0.

Given that the blue button has been pressed the most and has the highest average reward, it is the most reliable choice based on the data we have. The other buttons have either very limited data or lower average rewards.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the blue button.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times

   - This button has been tested extensively and has the highest average reward.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Very little data, and the reward is 0, indicating it may not be a good choice.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 3 times
   - Average reward: 0.3333
   - Limited data, and the average reward is lower than blue.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times
   - Average reward: 0.5
   - Also limited data, but better than red and green.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Similar to green, very little data and a reward of 0.

Given that the blue button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it is the most reliable choice. The other buttons either have very low average rewards or insufficient data to make a confident decision.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the blue button.

   - Similar to green, very little data and a reward of 0.

Given that the blue button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it is the most reliable choice. The other buttons either have low average rewards or insufficient data to make a confident decision.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the blue button.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 89 times
   - Average reward: 0.6179775280898876
   - This button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Very little data, but the single reward was 0.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 3 times
   - Average reward: 0.3333333333333333
   - Low average reward and limited data.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times
   - Average reward: 0.5
   - Slightly better than red but still limited data.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time
   - Average reward: 0.0
   - Like green, very little data and the single reward was 0.

Given that the blue button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it is the most reliable choice. The other buttons either have low average rewards or insufficient data to make a confident decision.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the blue button.
