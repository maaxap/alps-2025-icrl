   - Pressed 5 times, average reward = 0.8
   - Total reward = 5 * 0.8 = 4.0

From this summary, we can see that the purple button has the highest average reward (0.8) and has been pressed the most times (5). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on the data we have.

The blue and red buttons have the same average reward (0.5), but they have been pressed fewer times, which means we have less confidence in their performance compared to the purple button.

The green and yellow buttons have not performed well at all, with an average reward of 0.0.

Given this analysis, the best choice for the next button to press is the purple button.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.3333

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.3333

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 14 times, average reward = 0.4286

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **purple button** has the highest average reward (0.4286) and has been pressed the most (14 times). This suggests that it is likely a good choice based on the data we have.
- The **blue** and **red buttons** have the same average reward (0.3333), but they have been pressed fewer times (3 times each).
- The **green** and **yellow buttons** have not performed well, with an average reward of 0.0.

Given that the purple button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it is reasonable to choose it again to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the purple button next.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.3333

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 24 times, average reward = 0.4583

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **purple button** has the highest average reward (0.4583) and has been pressed the most (24 times). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on the data we have.
- The **blue** and **red buttons** have the same average reward (0.3333), but they have been pressed fewer times, which may indicate less certainty about their true average rewards.
- The **green** and **yellow buttons** have not performed well, with an average reward of 0.0.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.3333
2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.3333
4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 34 times, average reward = 0.3824

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **purple button** has the highest average reward (0.3824) and has been pressed the most (34 times). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on the data we have.
- The **blue** and **red buttons** have the same average reward (0.3333), but they have been pressed fewer times (3 times each), which means we have less confidence in their average.
- The **green** and **yellow buttons** have not performed well at all, with an average reward of 0.0.

Given that the purple button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it is reasonable to choose it again to maximize the total reward.

The red and purple buttons have the highest average rewards (0.3333). However, the purple button has been pressed significantly more times (39 times) compared to the red button (3 times). This suggests that the purple button has been tested more thoroughly, and its average reward is stable.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 4 times, average reward = 0.25
   - This button has a relatively low average reward.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - This button has not yielded any reward yet.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.3333
   - This button has a decent average reward, better than blue and green.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - Similar to green, this button has not yielded any reward yet.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 43 times, average reward = 0.3488
   - This button has the highest average reward among all options.

Given that the purple button has been pressed the most and has the highest average reward, it seems to be the best option to maximize total reward. 

While the red button also has a good average reward, the purple button has significantly more data points, which suggests that its average is more reliable.

Therefore, I will choose to press the purple button next.

The red button has a good average reward and has only been pressed 3 times, indicating that it might still have potential for higher rewards with more exploration.

Considering the balance between exploration and exploitation, I will choose the red button for the next press, as it has a good average reward and has not been pressed as many times as the purple button.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 4 times, average reward = 0.25

   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 52 times, average reward = 0.34615384615384615

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **purple button** has the highest average reward (approximately 0.346) and has been pressed the most times (52). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on the data we have.
- The **blue** and **red buttons** have the same average reward (0.25), but they have been pressed fewer times, which may indicate less reliability.
- The **green** and **yellow buttons** have not performed well, with an average reward of 0.0.

Given that the purple button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is reasonable to choose it again to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the purple button next.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 4 times, average reward = 0.25
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 4 times, average reward = 0.25
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 73 times, average reward = 0.4383561643835616

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **purple button** has the highest average reward (approximately 0.44) and has been pressed the most times (73). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on the data we have.
- The **blue** and **red buttons** have the same average reward (0.25), which is lower than the purple button.
- The **green** and **yellow buttons** have only been pressed once and have an average reward of 0.0, indicating they are not good choices based on the limited data.

Given that the purple button has a significantly higher average reward and has been tested extensively, it is reasonable to choose it again to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the purple button.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 4 times, average reward = 0.25
   - This button has a relatively low average reward.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - This button has not performed well at all.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 4 times, average reward = 0.25
   - Similar to the blue button, it has a low average reward.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - Like the green button, it has not performed well.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 84 times, average reward = 0.44047619047619047
   - This button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most times.

Given that the purple button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is the most reliable choice based on the data. 

Therefore, I will choose the purple button for the next press.
