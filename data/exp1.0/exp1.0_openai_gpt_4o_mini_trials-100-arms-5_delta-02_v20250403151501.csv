- The purple button has been pressed 21 times and has an average reward of approximately 0.619. This suggests that the purple button is likely the best option based on the data we have.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 46 times, average reward = 0.6956521739130435

From this data, we can see that the purple button has been pressed the most (46 times) and has a significantly higher average reward compared to the other buttons, which have all been pressed only once and yielded a reward of 0.0.

Given that the purple button has shown a strong performance, it is reasonable to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward over the remaining time steps.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the purple button.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 58 times, average reward = 0.6897 (approximately)

The purple button has been pressed the most and has a significantly higher average reward compared to the other buttons, which have all yielded an average reward of 0.0. Given that the purple button has shown consistent performance, it is the most promising option.

Since we want to maximize the total reward over the remaining time steps, the logical choice is to continue pressing the purple button.

- The blue, green, red, and yellow buttons have only been pressed once each, and all have an average reward of 0.0. This indicates that they have not provided any positive reward in their single trial.
- The purple button has been pressed 83 times and has an average reward of approximately 0.639. This suggests that the purple button is likely the best option based on the data we have.

Since the goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, it makes sense to continue pressing the button that has shown the highest average reward. The purple button has demonstrated a consistent positive reward, while the other buttons have not provided any reward at all.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button press is the purple button.

4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 95 times, average reward = 0.6526315789473685

From this data, we can see that the purple button has been pressed the most (95 times) and has a significantly higher average reward compared to the other buttons, which have all been pressed only once and yielded a reward of 0.0.

Given that the purple button has shown a consistent positive reward, it is the best choice to maximize the total reward over the remaining time steps.

Therefore, I will choose the purple button for the next press.
