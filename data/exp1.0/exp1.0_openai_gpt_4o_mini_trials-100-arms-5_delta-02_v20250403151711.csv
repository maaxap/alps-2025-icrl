The red button has the highest average reward (0.6) among all the buttons. The blue and yellow buttons have the same average reward (0.5), but they are lower than the red button. The green and purple buttons have not performed well at all.

Given that the red button has the highest average reward, it would be a logical choice to press it again to maximize the total reward.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 15 times, average reward = 0.6
   - This button has the highest average reward and a significant number of trials, making it a strong candidate.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
   - Similar to blue, it has a moderate average reward but limited data.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - Like green, this button has a very low average reward with only one trial.

Given this information, the red button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, which gives us more confidence in its performance. 

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the red button.

2. **Green Button**:

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
   - This button has a low sample size, so the average may not be reliable.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - Very low sample size and a poor reward. Not a good choice.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 68 times, average reward = 0.6470588235294118
   - This button has the highest average reward and a significant sample size, making it a strong candidate.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
   - Similar to blue, it has a low sample size, so the average may not be reliable.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - Like green, it has a very low sample size and a poor reward. Not a good choice.

Given that the red button has been pressed the most times and has the highest average reward, it is the best option to maximize the total reward.

   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - Like green, it has very limited data and a poor reward.

Given that the red button has been pressed the most times and has the highest average reward, it is the most reliable choice based on the information available.

Therefore, I will choose the red button for the next press.

Each button is associated with a Bernoulli distribution with a fixed but unknown mean; the means for the buttons could be different. For each button, when you press it, you will get a reward that is sampled from the button's associated distribution. You have 100 time steps and, on each time step, you can choose any button and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps.

1. **Blue Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
   - This button has a low number of trials, so we have limited information about its true mean.

2. **Green Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - Very limited data, and the single trial resulted in a reward of 0.

3. **Red Button**: 
   - Pressed 90 times, average reward = 0.6
   - This button has the highest number of trials and a relatively high average reward. It seems to be the best-performing button based on the data.

4. **Yellow Button**: 
   - Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
   - Similar to the blue button, it has limited data but a decent average reward.

5. **Purple Button**: 
   - Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
   - Like the green button, it has very limited data and resulted in a reward of 0.

Given that the red button has been pressed the most and has the highest average reward, it is the most reliable choice based on the information we have. 

Therefore, I will choose the red button for the next press.
