Since the yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed yet, they could potentially yield unknown rewards. However, since we have two buttons (blue and green) that have already shown positive results, it would be prudent to continue exploring these options before trying the untested buttons.

The orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been tested yet, but since we have limited time steps and the purple button has already proven to be effective, it makes sense to stick with what is working.

Given this analysis, I will choose the purple button again.

From this summary, we can see that the purple button has the highest average reward (0.75) and has been pressed the most (4 times). This suggests that it is likely a good choice.

The other buttons (blue and green) have the same average reward (0.5), but they have been pressed fewer times than the purple button. The red and yellow buttons have not performed well (0.0 average reward), and the remaining buttons (orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been tested at all.

Given that the purple button has shown the best performance so far, it would be wise to press it again to gather more data and potentially maximize the reward.

The other buttons (blue and green) have the same average reward (0.5), but they have been pressed fewer times, which means we have less confidence in their average rewards compared to the purple button.

The buttons that have not been pressed at all (orange, brown, pink, black, white) have unknown rewards, so we cannot make an informed decision about them yet.

The orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all. Since we have 100 time steps and still have many options left, it might be beneficial to explore one of the unpressed buttons to gather more information about their potential rewards.

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **orange button** has the highest average reward (1.0) and has been pressed 6 times, indicating it is likely a good choice.
- The **purple, blue, and green buttons** have the same average reward of 0.5, but they are not as promising as the orange button.
- The **red** and **yellow buttons** have not performed well (0.0 average reward).
- The **brown, pink, black, and white buttons** have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

   - The buttons that have not been pressed at all (brown, pink, black, white) have unknown rewards, but they could potentially yield higher rewards since we have no data on them.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Since the buttons blue, green, purple, and orange have shown consistent average rewards of 0.5, they are good candidates.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To decide which button to press next, let's analyze the data we have:

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.5
6. **Orange Button**: Pressed 14 times, average reward = 0.5
7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 1.0
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 0 times
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

### Analysis:
- The **Brown Button** has the highest average reward (1.0) but has only been pressed once. This suggests it might be a good candidate to press again to confirm its mean.
- The **Blue**, **Green**, **Purple**, and **Orange** buttons have the same average reward of 0.5, but they have been pressed multiple times, indicating that their means are likely more stable.
- The **Red** and **Yellow** buttons have not performed well (0.0 average reward) and should be avoided.
- The **Pink**, **Black**, and **White** buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards.

### Decision:
Given that the Brown Button has the highest average reward and has only been pressed once, it would be prudent to press it again to gather more data and confirm its mean.

Thus, I will choose the Brown Button.

   - **Brown**: 8 times, average reward 0.5
   - **Pink**: 1 time, average reward 1.0
   - **Black**: 0 times
   - **White**: 0 times

2. **Analysis**:
   - The **pink button** has the highest average reward (1.0) but has only been pressed once. This suggests it might be a good candidate to press again to confirm its reward.
   - The **black** and **white buttons** have not been pressed at all, which means we have no information about their rewards. However, since we have limited time steps left, it might be more beneficial to explore buttons that have shown some reward.
   - The other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, orange, brown) have average rewards of 0.5 or lower, with red and yellow showing no reward at all.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given that the pink button has the highest average reward and has only been pressed once, it would be wise to press it again to gather more information and potentially confirm its high reward.

Therefore, I will choose the pink button next.

1. **Buttons Pressed and Their Rewards**:
   - **Blue**: 2 times, average reward 0.5

   - **Pink**: 2 times, average reward 0.5
   - **Black**: 0 times
   - **White**: 0 times

2. **Analysis**:
   - The buttons that have been pressed the most (orange, purple, brown) all have the same average reward of 0.5. 
   - The buttons that have been pressed the least (black and white) have not been tested at all, which means we have no information about their potential rewards.
   - The buttons with the lowest average rewards (red and yellow) have only been pressed once, which may not be enough to draw a conclusion about their true potential.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Since the buttons orange, purple, and brown have been pressed multiple times and have shown consistent average rewards, they are likely to be safe choices.
   - However, since black and white have not been pressed at all, they could potentially yield higher rewards than the others, but we have no data to support that.

Given that we have 100 time steps and still have many opportunities to explore, it might be wise to try one of the untested buttons to gather more information.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - I will choose the black button since it has not been pressed yet, allowing us to explore its potential reward.

   - The **black button** has only been pressed once, but it yielded a reward of 1.0, which is the highest observed reward.
   - The **white button** has not been pressed at all, so we have no information about its potential reward.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given that the **black button** has the highest average reward from its single press, it is a strong candidate for the next choice.
   - The **white button** could also be an option since it hasn't been tested, but without any prior data, it is uncertain.

Considering the above analysis, I will choose the **black button** for the next press.

10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **black button** has the highest average reward (0.75) and has been pressed the most (16 times). This suggests that it is a strong candidate for maximizing future rewards.
- The **red** and **yellow buttons** have not performed well (0.0 average reward) and have been pressed only once each, indicating they are not good choices.
- The other buttons (blue, green, purple, orange, brown, pink) have average rewards of 0.5, but they have been pressed fewer times compared to the black button.

Given that the black button has the highest average reward and has been tested sufficiently to suggest reliability, it would be a logical choice to press it again.

Therefore, I will choose the black button next.

9. **Black Button**: Pressed 24 times, average reward = 0.7083
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that the black button has the highest average reward (approximately 0.7083) and has been pressed the most times (24). This suggests that it is a reliable choice based on the data we have.

The other buttons have lower average rewards or have been pressed fewer times, which means we have less confidence in their performance.

Given that the black button has shown to yield the highest average reward, it would be the best choice for maximizing total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the black button next.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 58 times, average reward = 0.6897 (highest average reward)
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times (no data)

Given that the black button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most times (58), it indicates that it is likely a good choice based on the data we have. 

The other buttons have lower or equal average rewards but have been pressed fewer times, which means they may not be as reliable as the black button. The white button has not been pressed at all, so we have no information about its potential.

Considering all of this, the best choice for maximizing the total reward is to press the black button again.
