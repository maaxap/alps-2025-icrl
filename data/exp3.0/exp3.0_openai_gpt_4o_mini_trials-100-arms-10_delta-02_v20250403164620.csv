The other buttons (blue, green, red) have either lower average rewards or have been pressed very few times, which makes it harder to estimate their true performance. The buttons that have not been pressed at all (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have unknown rewards, but since we have a strong candidate in yellow, it makes sense to continue exploiting that option.

Given that the blue button has the highest average reward (0.5) among the buttons that have been pressed, it seems like a good choice. The yellow button has been pressed the most but has a lower average reward than the blue button.

Since we want to maximize our total reward, I will choose the blue button for the next press.

- The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.4) among the buttons that have been pressed.
- The **yellow button** has a decent average reward (0.3333) but has been pressed significantly more times (30 times), which may indicate that its average could be less reliable due to the number of trials.
- The other buttons (green, red) have not performed well based on their single trials (0.0).
- The buttons that have not been pressed at all (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have unknown rewards, but since they haven't been tested, we cannot assume they will perform well.

From the summary, we can see that the blue and yellow buttons have the same average reward of 0.3333, but the yellow button has been pressed significantly more times (30 times) compared to the blue button (6 times). This suggests that the yellow button has been more consistently tested, and its average reward is stable.

The other buttons (green, red) have not performed well, yielding a reward of 0. The buttons that have not been pressed at all (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have unknown rewards, but since we have no prior data on them, they are less reliable choices.

Given that the yellow button has a solid average reward and has been tested extensively, it would be a reasonable choice to continue pressing it. However, since the blue button has also shown a decent average reward and has been pressed less, it might be worth exploring further.

Considering the balance between exploration and exploitation, I will choose to press the blue button next, as it has shown a good average reward and has room for more exploration.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 10 times with an average reward of 0.3.
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0.

7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 0 times.
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 0 times.
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times.
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times.

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **yellow button** has the highest average reward (0.33) and has been pressed the most (33 times). This suggests that it is a reliable choice.
- The **blue button** has a decent average reward (0.3) but has been pressed less frequently than the yellow button.
- The other buttons (green, red, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have either not been pressed or have very low average rewards.

Given that the yellow button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it is a strong candidate for maximizing future rewards.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button for the next press.

From this summary, we can see that the yellow button has been pressed the most (41 times) and has a slightly higher average reward (0.29) compared to the blue button (0.27). However, since the yellow button has been pressed so many times, it may be beneficial to explore other buttons that have not been pressed yet to gather more information about their potential rewards.

The purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all. Since we have 100 time steps and still have many left, it would be wise to explore one of these untested buttons.

Given that we have no prior information about the unpressed buttons, I will choose to press the **purple button** next. This will allow us to gather new data and potentially discover a button with a higher reward.

The other buttons (green, red, purple) have not yielded any rewards yet, and the orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all.

Given that the yellow button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is a strong candidate for maximizing the total reward.

However, since we still have some time steps left (45 remaining), it might also be beneficial to explore the unpressed buttons (orange, brown, pink, black, white) to gather more information about their potential rewards.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 11 times, average reward = 0.2727
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 54 times, average reward = 0.2963
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
6. **Orange Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 0 times
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **yellow button** has the highest average reward (0.2963) and has been pressed the most (54 times). This suggests that it is a reliable choice.
- The **blue button** has a decent average reward (0.2727) but has been pressed significantly fewer times than the yellow button.
- The other buttons (green, red, purple, orange, brown) have not performed well, with average rewards of 0.0, and they have been pressed very few times.
- The **pink, black, and white buttons** have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

Given that the yellow button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it is reasonable to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button next.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To make a good choice for the next button to press, let's analyze the data provided:

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 11 times, average reward = 0.2727
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 61 times, average reward = 0.2787
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
6. **Orange Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 1.0
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **pink button** has the highest average reward (1.0) but has only been pressed once. This suggests it might be a good candidate for pressing again to confirm its reward potential.
- The **yellow button** and **blue button** have been pressed many times (61 and 11 times respectively) but have lower average rewards (0.2787 and 0.2727). This indicates they may not be as promising as the pink button.
- The **black** and **white buttons** have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

Given that the pink button has shown a perfect reward on its first press, it would be wise to press it again to gather more data and potentially confirm its high reward.

Therefore, I will choose the pink button for the next press.

- The **blue button** has also been pressed multiple times (11 times) with a similar average reward of 0.2727.
- The **pink button** has a higher average reward of 0.5 but has only been pressed 2 times, which means we have less confidence in its average due to the limited data.
- The **green, red, purple, orange, and brown buttons** have not performed well, with average rewards of 0.0.

Given that we have 100 time steps and we want to maximize our total reward, it would be wise to explore the **pink button** further since it has the highest average reward, despite the limited number of trials.

8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 9 times, average reward = 0.4444
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **pink button** has the highest average reward (0.4444) among the buttons that have been pressed multiple times.
- The **yellow button** has a decent average reward (0.2787) but has been pressed significantly more times (61 times).
- The **blue button** has a lower average reward (0.2727) and has also been pressed multiple times (11 times).
- The other buttons (green, red, purple, orange, brown) have not performed well, with average rewards of 0.0.

Given that the pink button has the highest average reward and has been pressed 9 times, it seems to be a strong candidate for maximizing the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the pink button for the next press.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 11 times, average reward = 0.2727
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 61 times, average reward = 0.2787
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
6. **Orange Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 17 times, average reward = 0.4118
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **pink button** has the highest average reward (0.4118) and has been pressed 17 times, indicating it has a consistent performance.
- The **yellow button** has a decent average reward (0.2787) but has been pressed significantly more times (61), which may indicate it is less optimal compared to the pink button.
- The other buttons (green, red, purple, orange, brown, black, and white) have either not been pressed or have very low average rewards.

Given that the pink button has the highest average reward and has been pressed a reasonable number of times, it is a strong candidate for maximizing the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the pink button for the next press.
