   - Black: 0 times
   - White: 0 times

2. **Analysis**:
   - The buttons blue, green, red, yellow, purple, and brown have all shown an average reward of 1.0, indicating they are performing well.
   - The orange and pink buttons have an average reward of 0.0, suggesting they are not good choices.
   - The black and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their performance.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - Since we have a limited number of time steps (100) and have already pressed some buttons multiple times, it might be beneficial to explore the black and white buttons to gather more information about their potential rewards.
   - However, since the other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown) have shown consistent rewards, it might be wise to continue pressing one of them to maximize the total reward.

4. **Decision**:
   - Given that blue, green, red, yellow, purple, and brown have all shown good performance, I will choose one of these buttons. Since blue and green have been pressed the most (2 times each), I will choose to press the blue button again to maintain consistency in maximizing the reward.

From this summary, we can see that the buttons with the highest average rewards are the green, red, yellow, purple, and brown buttons, all with an average reward of 1.0. 

The blue button has a decent average reward of 0.67 but has been pressed the most (3 times), which suggests that it may not yield better results than the others. The orange and pink buttons have not performed well, with an average reward of 0.0.

Since the green button has been pressed only 2 times and has a high average reward of 1.0, it seems like a good candidate for the next choice. 

Additionally, the black and white buttons have not been pressed at all, but we have no information about their potential rewards.

Given the current data, I will choose the green button for the next press.

   - The blue and green buttons have been pressed more frequently (3 times each) but have lower average rewards (0.67).
   - The orange and pink buttons have not performed well (0.0) and have been pressed once each.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation:**
   - Since we have a few buttons (red, yellow, purple, brown) that have shown high rewards but have not been explored much, it would be wise to explore one of these buttons further.
   - Given that all four of these buttons have the same average reward, we can choose any of them. However, since red, yellow, purple, and brown have all shown a reward of 1.0, I will choose one of them.

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **Red Button** has the highest average reward (0.86) and has been pressed the most (7 times), indicating it is likely a good choice.
- The **Yellow**, **Purple**, and **Brown Buttons** have a perfect average reward of 1.0, but they have only been pressed once each, which means we have limited information about their reliability.
- The **Black** and **White Buttons** have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards.

Given that the Red Button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it is a strong candidate for maximizing the total reward.

### Analysis:
- The **Red Button** has the highest average reward (0.875) but has been pressed the most (8 times). This suggests it is a reliable choice, but we may want to explore other options.
- The **Yellow**, **Purple**, and **Brown Buttons** each have an average reward of 1.0, but they have only been pressed once. This means they could be outliers or truly high-reward buttons.
- The **Black** and **White Buttons** have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards.

### Decision:
Given that the Yellow, Purple, and Brown buttons have shown a perfect score of 1.0, it would be wise to explore one of these buttons further. Since they have only been pressed once, we can gain more information about their potential.

Among the Yellow, Purple, and Brown buttons, I will choose to press the **Yellow Button** next, as it has shown a perfect score and has not been explored much.

The purple and brown buttons both have an average reward of 1.0 but have only been pressed once each. This indicates they might be worth exploring further.

The black and white buttons have not been pressed at all, which means we have no information about their potential rewards.

From this summary, the red button has the highest average reward, followed closely by the brown button, which has only been pressed once. 

Given that the red button has been tested the most and has the highest average reward, it is a strong candidate for the next choice. However, the brown button has a perfect score but has limited data (only pressed once). 

Since we want to maximize our total reward and the red button has a solid track record, I will choose the red button for the next press.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.67
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.67
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 20 times, average reward = 0.80 (highest average reward)

5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.50
6. **Orange Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.00
7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.50
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.00
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, the red button has the highest average reward (0.80) and has been pressed the most times (20). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on the data we have.

The other buttons have lower average rewards, and some have not been pressed at all (black and white). Given that the red button has shown consistent performance, it would be wise to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the red button for the next press.

- Green: 0.67 (3 presses)
- Red: 0.67 (36 presses)

- Orange: 0.0 (1 press)
- Brown: 0.5 (2 presses)
- Pink: 0.0 (1 press)
- Black: 0.0 (0 presses)
- White: 0.0 (0 presses)

From this summary, we can see that the blue button has the highest average reward (0.75), followed by green and red (both at 0.67). 

Given that the blue button has the highest average reward and has been pressed a reasonable number of times (4), it seems to be the best option for maximizing the total reward.

The other buttons either have lower average rewards or have not been pressed at all, which means we have no information about their potential rewards.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the blue button.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 5 times, average reward = 0.6
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.67
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 36 times, average reward = 0.67
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
6. **Orange Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

### Analysis:
- The **Red** and **Green** buttons have the highest average rewards (0.67). However, the Red button has been pressed significantly more times (36) compared to the Green button (3). This suggests that the Red button's average might be more stable due to more data.
- The **Blue** button has a decent average reward (0.6) but has been pressed less than Red.
- The **Yellow**, **Purple**, and **Brown** buttons have lower average rewards (0.5) and have been pressed fewer times.
- The **Orange** and **Pink** buttons have not performed well (0.0) and have been pressed very few times.
- The **Black** and **White** buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their performance.

### Decision:
Given that the Red button has the highest number of presses and a high average reward, it seems to be the most reliable choice. The Green button is also a good option, but it has less data to support its average.

Therefore, I will choose the **Red** button for the next press.

From this summary, we can see that the red button has the highest average reward (0.68) and has been pressed the most (37 times). The green button also has a relatively high average reward (0.67) but has been pressed fewer times (3 times). 

The blue button has a decent average reward (0.6) but is lower than both red and green. The other buttons either have lower average rewards or have not been pressed at all.

Given that the red button has the highest average reward and a significant number of trials, it is a strong candidate for maximizing the total reward. However, since we have already pressed it 37 times, it might be beneficial to explore other options to gather more information about their rewards.

The green button has a high average reward and has been pressed only 3 times, which suggests it might still have potential for higher rewards with more exploration.

Considering the balance between exploitation (choosing the button with the highest average reward) and exploration (trying buttons that haven't been pressed much), I will choose the green button next.

From this summary, the red button has the highest average reward, and it has been pressed the most times, indicating that it is likely a good choice. 

The other buttons (blue and green) have the same average reward of 0.6, but they have been pressed fewer times than the red button. The yellow, purple, brown, orange, and pink buttons have lower average rewards, and the black and white buttons have not been pressed at all.

Given that the red button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is a strong candidate for maximizing the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the red button next.

From this summary, the red button has the highest average reward (0.66) and has been pressed the most (50 times), indicating it is likely a good choice based on the data we have.

The other buttons (blue and green) have the same average reward (0.6), but they have been pressed significantly fewer times. The yellow, purple, brown, orange, and pink buttons have lower average rewards and have been pressed fewer times, which suggests they are less reliable.

The black and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards.

Given that the red button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it is reasonable to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward.

10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From the summary, the red button has the highest average reward (0.655) and has been pressed the most times (58). This suggests that it is a reliable choice based on the data we have.

The blue and green buttons have the same average reward (0.6), but they have been pressed significantly fewer times (5 times each). This means we have less confidence in their average rewards compared to the red button.

The yellow, purple, brown, orange, and pink buttons have lower average rewards or have been pressed very few times, making them less attractive options.

The black and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards.

Given that the red button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is the best choice for maximizing the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the red button next.

The other buttons (blue, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink) have lower average rewards or have been pressed very few times, making them less reliable choices.

Given that we want to maximize the total reward and the red button has the highest average reward, it would be logical to press the red button again.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To decide which button to press next, let's analyze the data provided:

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 6 times, average reward = 0.5
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 5 times, average reward = 0.6
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 74 times, average reward = 0.662
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5

8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From the summary, the red button has the highest average reward (0.662) and has been pressed the most times (74). This suggests that it is a reliable choice. The green button also has a decent average reward (0.6) but has been pressed fewer times (5), indicating less certainty about its performance.

The other buttons (blue, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) either have lower average rewards or have been pressed very few times, making them less reliable choices.

Given that the red button has the highest average reward and a significant number of trials, it is the best option to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the red button next.

### Analysis:
- The **Red Button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most times, indicating it is likely a good choice.
- The **Green Button** has a slightly lower average reward but has been pressed fewer times, suggesting it might still have potential.
- The **Blue Button** has a lower average reward than both Red and Green.
- The other buttons (Yellow, Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink) have either low average rewards or have been pressed very few times, making them less reliable choices.
- The **Black** and **White Buttons** have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential.

Given that the Red Button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is the most reliable choice.

### Conclusion:
I will choose the Red Button for the next press.
