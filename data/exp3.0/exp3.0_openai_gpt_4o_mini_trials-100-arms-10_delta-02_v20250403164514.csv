10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that the red button has been pressed the most and has the highest average reward of 0.625. The other buttons have either not been pressed at all or have very low average rewards.

Since we want to maximize our total reward, it would be wise to continue pressing the red button, as it has shown to yield a positive reward consistently.

However, we also have the option to explore the buttons that have not been pressed yet (yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) to gather more information about their potential rewards. But given that we have only 100 time steps and we want to maximize our reward, it is more prudent to stick with the red button for now.

Therefore, my choice for the next button to press is:

Since the red button has shown to be the most rewarding option based on the data, it would be wise to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward. However, we also have several buttons that have not been pressed at all (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white), which could potentially yield better rewards if their distributions are favorable.

Given that we have 80 time steps left, it might also be beneficial to explore some of the untested buttons after a few more presses of the red button. But for the immediate next step, I will choose the button that has provided the best reward so far.

- The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.652) and has been pressed the most (23 times). This suggests that it is a strong candidate for maximizing rewards.
- The **yellow button** has a decent average reward (0.5) but has only been pressed 2 times, which means we have less confidence in its performance.
- The other buttons (blue, green, purple) have not performed well based on their average rewards (all at 0.0).
- The **orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons** have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

Given that the red button has shown the best performance so far, it would be logical to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the red button again.

From this summary, the red button has the highest average reward (0.64) and has been pressed the most times (25). This suggests that it is likely a good choice, but it may also be nearing its optimal performance due to the number of times it has been pressed.

The yellow button has a decent average reward (0.5) but has only been pressed 2 times, indicating that it may still have potential for higher rewards.

The other buttons (blue, green, purple) have not performed well, and the buttons that have not been pressed at all (orange, brown, pink, black, white) have unknown performance.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 30 times, average reward 0.6333

7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 0 times
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 0 times
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that the red button has the highest average reward (0.6333) and has been pressed the most (30 times). This suggests that it is likely a good choice.

The other buttons (blue, green, purple, orange) have not yielded any rewards, and the yellow button has a lower average reward (0.3333) compared to the red button. The brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

Given that the red button has shown a strong performance, it would be wise to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the red button next.

From the summary, the red button has the highest average reward, and it has been pressed the most times (39). This suggests that it is likely a good choice based on the data we have.

However, we also have several buttons (brown, pink, black, white) that have not been pressed at all. Since we have 100 time steps and still have 54 remaining, it might be beneficial to explore some of these untested buttons to gather more information about their potential rewards.

- The **Brown Button** has a perfect average reward of 1.0, but it has only been pressed once, so we have limited information about its reliability.
- The **Yellow Button** has a lower average reward than Red but has been pressed more than Brown.
- The buttons that have not been pressed at all (Pink, Black, White) have unknown rewards.

Given that the Brown Button has the highest average reward but only one sample, it might be worth trying again to confirm if it consistently gives high rewards. However, since the Red Button has a good number of samples and a solid average reward, it is a safer choice.

Considering the balance between exploration (trying new buttons) and exploitation (choosing the button with the highest known average reward), I will choose the Brown Button again to see if the high reward is consistent.

Thus, my choice will be:

1. **Red Button**: Pressed 46 times with an average reward of approximately 0.52. This button has the highest number of presses and a decent average reward, indicating it is likely a good choice.

2. **Brown Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. This button has a relatively high average reward, but it has been pressed very few times, so we have less confidence in this estimate.

3. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 3 times with an average reward of approximately 0.33. This is lower than both red and brown.

4. **Blue, Green, Purple, Orange Buttons**: Each of these buttons has been pressed only once and has an average reward of 0.0. They are not promising choices based on the current data.

5. **Pink, Black, White Buttons**: These buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

Given that the red button has the most data (46 presses) and the highest average reward, it is the most reliable choice. The brown button is also a potential candidate, but it has significantly less data.

Therefore, the best choice for the next button to press is the red button.

The yellow and brown buttons have lower average rewards (0.33) but have been pressed more than the other buttons (3 times each). The blue, green, purple, orange buttons have not yielded any rewards yet, and the pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all.

Given that the red button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is reasonable to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the red button again.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To decide which button to press next, let's analyze the data provided:

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 61 times, average reward = 0.4918 (highest average reward)
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.3333
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
6. **Orange Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.3333
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 0 times
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From the summary, the red button has the highest average reward, and it has been pressed the most times (61). This suggests that it is likely a good choice, as we have a significant amount of data supporting its performance.

The other buttons (blue, green, purple, orange) have not performed well, yielding an average reward of 0. The yellow and brown buttons have a slightly better average reward but are still lower than the red button.

The pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their performance.

Given that the red button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is reasonable to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the red button next.

Given that the red button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is a strong candidate for maximizing the total reward.

However, since we have 100 time steps and still have some buttons that have not been pressed at all (pink, black, white), it might be worth exploring one of those options. But since the red button has shown a significant reward, it is prudent to continue pressing it.

Therefore, I will choose the red button again.

The yellow and brown buttons have lower average rewards (0.3333) but have been pressed fewer times, which means they might still have potential. However, given the significant amount of data from the red button, it is reasonable to conclude that it is the best choice.

The black and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards.

Considering all of this, the best choice for the next button to press is the red button.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 85 times, average reward = 0.4353

8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that the red button has the highest average reward (0.4353) and has been pressed the most (85 times). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on the data we have.

The yellow and brown buttons have lower average rewards (0.3333) but have been pressed significantly fewer times than the red button. The other buttons (blue, green, purple, orange, pink) have not yielded any rewards or have been pressed very few times, making them less reliable choices.

Given that we have only 4 time steps left (since we have played 96 times), it would be prudent to continue pressing the red button, as it has shown the best performance so far.

Therefore, I will choose the red button for the next press.
