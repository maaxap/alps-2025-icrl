1. **Buttons Pressed and Rewards**:
   - Blue: 1 time, average reward 0.0
   - Green: 1 time, average reward 0.0
   - Red: 1 time, average reward 0.0
   - Yellow: 8 times, average reward 0.625
   - Purple: 0 times
   - Orange: 0 times
   - Brown: 0 times
   - Pink: 0 times
   - Black: 0 times
   - White: 0 times

2. **Analysis**:
   - The yellow button has been pressed the most (8 times) and has the highest average reward (0.625). This suggests that it is likely a good choice based on the data we have.
   - The other buttons (blue, green, red) have not yielded any rewards, and they have only been pressed once each, which does not provide enough information to make a confident decision about their potential.
   - The remaining buttons (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given that the yellow button has the highest average reward and has been tested multiple times, it is reasonable to continue pressing the yellow button to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button next.

1. **Button Presses and Rewards**:
   - The yellow button has been pressed 18 times and has an average reward of approximately 0.56, which is significantly higher than the other buttons that have been pressed only once and received a reward of 0.0.
   - The blue, green, and red buttons have all been pressed once and have an average reward of 0.0, indicating they are not promising options at this time.
   - The purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

2. **Decision Making**:
   - Since the yellow button has shown a positive average reward, it is a strong candidate for maximizing total reward.
   - The other buttons either have no data or have shown no reward, making them less favorable choices at this moment.

Given this analysis, the best choice for the next button press is the yellow button, as it has the highest average reward based on past performance.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button.

1. **Yellow Button**: This button has been pressed 29 times and has an average reward of approximately 0.48. This is the highest average reward among all the buttons, indicating that it is likely the best option based on past performance.

2. **Other Buttons**: The blue, green, and red buttons have all been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, which suggests they are not good options. The purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

1. **Buttons Pressed**: 
   - The yellow button has been pressed 40 times and has an average reward of 0.475, which is significantly higher than the other buttons.
   - The blue, green, and red buttons have been pressed only once each and have an average reward of 0.0.
   - The purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all.

2. **Current Strategy**: 
   - Since the yellow button has shown a positive average reward, it is a strong candidate for the next choice.
   - The other buttons have either not been tested or have shown no reward, making them less favorable at this point.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: 
   - While it might be tempting to explore the untested buttons, the yellow button has already demonstrated a decent average reward. Given that we have limited time steps (only 100 total), it is crucial to maximize rewards based on the information we have.

Given this analysis, the best choice for the next button to press is the yellow button.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To decide which button to press next, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Past Choices and Rewards**:
   - The yellow button has been pressed 83 times and has an average reward of approximately 0.434. This indicates that the yellow button is likely the best option based on past performance.
   - The blue, green, and red buttons have all been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, which suggests they are not good options.
   - The purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their performance.

2. **Strategy**:
   - Since the yellow button has a significantly higher average reward compared to the others, it would be wise to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward.
   - The other buttons either have no data or have shown poor performance, so they are not good candidates for the next choice.

Given this analysis, the best choice for the next button to press is the yellow button.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","Based on the summary of past choices and rewards, we can analyze the situation:

1. **Yellow Button**: This button has been pressed 94 times and has an average reward of approximately 0.426. This is the only button with a significant amount of data, and it shows a positive average reward. Therefore, it seems to be the best option based on the information we have.

2. **Other Buttons**: The blue, green, and red buttons have all been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. This indicates that they are not performing well. The purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their performance.

Given that the yellow button has a strong average reward and has been tested extensively, it is the most reliable choice.

Therefore, I will choose the yellow button for the next press.

1. **Yellow Button**: This button has been pressed 95 times and has an average reward of approximately 0.43. This is the highest average reward among all the buttons, indicating that it is likely the best option based on past performance.

2. **Other Buttons**: The blue, green, and red buttons have all been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. The purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all, meaning we have no information about their potential rewards.

Given that the yellow button has a significantly higher average reward compared to the others, it would be logical to continue pressing the yellow button to maximize the total reward.
