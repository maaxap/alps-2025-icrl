   - The blue and green buttons have the highest average reward (0.5), but they have both been pressed twice. 
   - The other buttons (red, yellow, purple, orange, brown) have not yielded any rewards yet, as they have only been pressed once and returned 0.
   - The pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation:**
   - Since blue and green have shown some promise, we could exploit these options further.
   - However, since we have not explored the pink, black, and white buttons at all, it might be beneficial to explore one of these options to gather more information.

4. **Decision:**
   - Given that blue and green have already been tested and yielded a decent reward, I will choose to explore one of the untested buttons. 
   - Among the untested buttons, I will choose pink, as it is one of the options that could potentially yield a new reward.

From this summary, we can see that the green button has the highest average reward (0.5) among the buttons that have been pressed. The blue button has a decent average reward (0.3333), but since the green button has a higher average, it would be a better choice.

Additionally, the black and white buttons have not been pressed at all, which means we have no information about their potential rewards. However, since we already have a clear winner in the green button, it makes sense to exploit that option rather than exploring the untested buttons.

From this summary, we can see that the blue and green buttons have the highest average rewards. The green button has a slightly higher average reward than the blue button, but it has been pressed fewer times, which means it might still have potential for higher rewards.

The red, yellow, purple, orange, brown, and pink buttons have all yielded 0 rewards, and since they have been pressed only once, they are not promising choices at this point. The black and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential.

Given that the green button has a higher average reward and has been pressed fewer times, it might be a good candidate for exploration. However, since the blue button has been pressed more times and has a decent average reward, it might also be a safe choice.

Considering the balance between exploration and exploitation, I will choose the green button for the next press, as it has the highest average reward among the buttons pressed.

10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, the **green button** has the highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed the most (8 times). This suggests that it is likely a good choice since we have more data on its performance.

The **blue button** has a lower average reward (0.25) and has been pressed 4 times, which is also decent but not as promising as the green button.

The other buttons (red, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink) have not performed well based on their single press with a reward of 0.0, and the black and white buttons have not been pressed at all.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 4 times, average reward = 0.25
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 16 times, average reward = 0.5625
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From the summary, the green button has the highest average reward (0.5625) and has been pressed the most (16 times). This suggests that it is likely a good choice since it has provided a relatively high reward consistently.

The blue button has a lower average reward (0.25) and has been pressed more times than the other buttons, but it still does not outperform the green button.

The other buttons (red, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink) have not shown any positive rewards yet, and the black and white buttons have not been pressed at all.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward, it would be the best choice to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the green button next.

You have 100 time steps and, on each time step, you can choose any button and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps.

At each time step, I will show you a summary of your past choices and rewards.

8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, the green button has the highest average reward (0.44) and has been pressed the most (25 times). This suggests that it is likely a good choice since it has provided a relatively high reward consistently.

The blue button has a lower average reward (0.25) and has been pressed more times than the other buttons, but it still does not outperform the green button.

The other buttons (red, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink) have not shown any positive rewards yet, and the black and white buttons have not been pressed at all.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward, it would be the best choice to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the green button next.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 33 times, average reward = 0.4545 (highest average reward)
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, the green button has the highest average reward, and it has been pressed the most times (33). This suggests that it is likely to be a good choice since we have more data on its performance.

The other buttons (red, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink) have not performed well based on their single press, and the black and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about them.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward and a significant number of trials, it is the best option to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the green button next.

From this summary, we can see that the green button has the highest average reward (0.38) and has been pressed the most (42 times). This suggests that it is likely a good choice since we have a significant amount of data supporting its performance.

The blue button has a lower average reward (0.25) and has been pressed more times than the other buttons, but it still does not outperform the green button.

The other buttons (red, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink) have not shown any positive rewards yet, and the black and white buttons have not been pressed at all.

From this summary, we can see that the green button has the highest average reward (0.44) and has been pressed the most (50 times). This suggests that it is likely a good choice since we have a substantial amount of data supporting its performance.

The blue button has a lower average reward (0.25) and has been pressed 4 times, which is significantly less than the green button. The other buttons have either not been pressed at all or have very low average rewards from very few presses.

Given that the green button has shown the best performance so far, it would be logical to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the green button next.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 4 times, average reward = 0.25
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 67 times, average reward = 0.44776
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0

8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that the **green button** has the highest average reward (0.44776) and has been pressed the most (67 times). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on the data we have.

The other buttons, especially those that have been pressed only once (red, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink), have an average reward of 0.0, indicating they are not performing well. The blue button has a slightly better average reward than those but is still lower than the green button.

The black and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their performance.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is the most reliable choice.

Therefore, I will choose the green button next.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 4 times, average reward = 0.25
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 84 times, average reward = 0.39285714285714285
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
6. **Orange Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **green button** has the highest average reward (approximately 0.39) and has been pressed the most times (84). This suggests that it is a reliable choice.
- The **blue button** has a lower average reward (0.25) and has been pressed only 4 times, which indicates less certainty about its performance.
- All other buttons (red, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink) have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, indicating they are not good choices based on the limited data.
- The **black** and **white buttons** have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their performance.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is the best choice for maximizing the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the green button next.
