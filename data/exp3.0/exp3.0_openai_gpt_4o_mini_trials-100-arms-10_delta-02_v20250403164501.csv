1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0. This button has not been rewarding.
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 9 times, average reward = 0.4444. This button has shown to be the most rewarding so far.
3. **Red, Yellow, Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink, Black, White Buttons**: All have been pressed 0 times, meaning we have no information about their rewards.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward, it would be a logical choice to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward. 

However, since we have not explored the other buttons, there is a potential for discovering a better option. But with the current data, the green button is the best option.

Therefore, I will choose the green button again.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 18 times, average reward = 0.5556
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 1.0
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 0 times

7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 0 times
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 0 times
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **red button** has the highest average reward (1.0) but has only been pressed once. This suggests it might be a high-reward button, but we have very little data on it.
- The **green button** has been pressed 18 times and has a decent average reward (0.5556). This indicates it is a reliable choice based on the data we have.
- The other buttons (yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards.

Given that we have limited time steps left (80 remaining), we need to balance exploration and exploitation. The red button shows promise but lacks sufficient data. The green button, on the other hand, has a solid average reward and a lot of data backing it.

Considering the above points, I will choose the **green button** for the next press to maximize the expected reward based on the information available.

- The other buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

Given that we want to maximize our total reward and we have limited information, we have two main options:

1. **Press the red button** again to gather more data on its reward potential, as it has the highest average reward.
2. **Press the green button** again, which has a good average reward and a lot of data backing it up.

Since the red button has only been pressed once, it could be a high variance option. The green button, while not the highest average, has a solid track record.

Considering the need for a balance between exploration (trying new buttons) and exploitation (choosing the best-known option), I will choose to press the **red button** again to gather more information about its reward potential.

The other buttons (yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most, it is a strong candidate for maximizing our total reward. 

However, since we have 100 time steps and still have many buttons that haven't been pressed, it might be worth exploring one of the untested buttons to gather more information.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 26 times, average reward = 0.5769
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 0 times

7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 0 times
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 0 times
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **green button** has the highest average reward (0.5769) and has been pressed the most (26 times). This suggests that it is a reliable choice.
- The **red button** has a decent average reward (0.5) but has been pressed only 2 times, which is not enough to draw strong conclusions about its reliability.
- The **blue button** has a very low average reward (0.0) and has been pressed once, indicating it is not a good choice.
- The other buttons (yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is the best option to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the green button next.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 34 times, average reward = 0.6176
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 1.0
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times
6. **Orange Button**: Pressed 0 times
7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 0 times
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 0 times
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **green button** has been pressed the most and has a decent average reward of 0.6176.
- The **yellow button** has the highest average reward of 1.0, but it has only been pressed once, which means it may not be reliable yet.
- The **red button** has a lower average reward of 0.5 but has been pressed twice.
- The **blue button** has not performed well at all with an average reward of 0.0.

Given that the yellow button has the highest average reward but is based on a single trial, it might be worth exploring further. However, the green button has a solid number of trials and a good average reward.

Considering the balance between exploration and exploitation, I will choose the yellow button to see if the high reward can be replicated.

Thus, my final answer is:

The red and yellow buttons have the same average reward (0.5) but have been pressed only 2 times each, which is not enough to confidently say they are better than the green button.

The other buttons (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their performance.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward and a significant number of trials, it is the best choice for maximizing the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the green button next.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0. This button has not performed well.
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 52 times, average reward = 0.5577. This button has the highest average reward and has been tested the most.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5. This button has a decent average reward but has been pressed very few times.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5. Similar to the red button, it has a decent average but limited data.
5. **Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink, Black, White Buttons**: All have not been pressed yet, so we have no information on their performance.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is the most reliable choice based on the available data. 

Therefore, I will choose the green button for the next press.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0. This button has not performed well.
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 62 times, average reward = 0.532. This button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5. This button has a decent average reward but has not been tested much.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5. Similar to red, it has a decent average reward but limited data.
5. **Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink, Black, White Buttons**: All have not been pressed yet, so we have no information on their performance.

Given that the green button has been pressed the most and has the highest average reward, it is the most reliable choice based on the data we have. 

The other buttons (red and yellow) have decent average rewards but are not as reliable as the green button due to the limited number of trials. The untested buttons could potentially yield better rewards, but without any data, they are a riskier choice.

Therefore, the best decision is to continue pressing the green button, as it has shown the best performance so far.

Given that the green button has the highest number of presses and a solid average reward, it seems to be the best option based on the data we have. However, since the red and yellow buttons also have a good average reward but limited data, it might be worth exploring one of them as well.

Since the green button has already been pressed 63 times, it might be beneficial to explore either the red or yellow button next to gather more information about their potential.

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **green button** has the highest average reward (0.5286) and has been pressed the most (70 times). This suggests that it is a reliable choice.
- The **yellow button** has a decent average reward (0.5) but has been pressed only 2 times, which means we have less confidence in its performance.
- The **red button** has a lower average reward (0.3333) and has been pressed 3 times.
- The **blue button** has not performed well (0.0) and has been pressed once.
- The remaining buttons (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their performance.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 79 times, average reward = 0.5316
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.3333

7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 0 times
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 0 times
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From the summary, the green button has the highest average reward (0.5316) and has been pressed the most (79 times). This suggests that it is likely the best option based on the data we have.

The other buttons have either been pressed very few times or not at all, which means we have little information about their potential rewards. However, since the green button has a strong track record, it would be wise to continue pressing it to maximize the total reward.

Given that we have 15 time steps left, it makes sense to continue exploiting the green button rather than exploring other buttons with less information.

Therefore, I will choose the green button for the next press.

3. **Red Button**: Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.3333. This button has a low average reward and a small sample size.

5. **Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink, Black, White Buttons**: All have not been pressed yet, so we have no information on their performance.

Given that the green button has been pressed the most and has the highest average reward, it seems to be the best option based on the data we have. 

However, since there are still buttons that have not been pressed at all, it might be worth exploring one of those options. But since we have a significant amount of data on the green button, it is likely to yield a good reward.

Considering the balance between exploration and exploitation, I will choose to press the green button again, as it has shown consistent performance.

2. **Green Button**: Pressed 88 times, average reward = 0.5
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.333
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5
5. **Purple Button**: Pressed 0 times
6. **Orange Button**: Pressed 0 times
7. **Brown Button**: Pressed 0 times
8. **Pink Button**: Pressed 0 times
9. **Black Button**: Pressed 0 times
10. **White Button**: Pressed 0 times

From this summary, we can see that:

- The **green button** has the highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed the most (88 times). This suggests that it is a reliable choice.
- The **yellow button** also has a decent average reward (0.5) but has been pressed only 2 times, which means we have less confidence in its average.
- The **red button** has a lower average reward (0.333) and has been pressed 3 times.
- The **blue button** has not yielded any reward (0.0) and has been pressed once.
- The remaining buttons (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward and has been tested extensively, it is the most logical choice to maximize the total reward.

Therefore, I will choose the green button next.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 1 time, average reward = 0.0. This button has not been rewarding.
2. **Green Button**: Pressed 89 times, average reward = 0.5056. This button has been the most rewarding based on the data.
3. **Red Button**: Pressed 3 times, average reward = 0.3333. This button has a moderate reward but is not as good as green.
4. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 2 times, average reward = 0.5. This button has a decent reward but still less than green.
5. **Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink, Black, White Buttons**: All have not been pressed yet, so we have no information on their rewards.

Given that the green button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most times, it is the best choice based on the information we have. 

While there are other buttons that have not been pressed, the green button has shown consistent performance, and since we are trying to maximize total reward, it makes sense to continue pressing the button that has yielded the best results so far.

Therefore, I will choose the green button.

However, since we have 4 time steps left and the purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been tested at all, it might be worth exploring one of those buttons to gather more information.

- The **yellow button** has a good average reward of 0.5 but has been pressed only 2 times.
- The **red button** has a lower average reward of 0.3333 and has been pressed 3 times.
- The **blue button** has a very low average reward of 0.0 and has been pressed once, indicating it is not a good choice.
- The **orange**, **brown**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** buttons have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

Given that the green button has a solid average reward and has been tested extensively, it is a safe choice. However, the purple button, despite being pressed only once, has shown the highest reward.
