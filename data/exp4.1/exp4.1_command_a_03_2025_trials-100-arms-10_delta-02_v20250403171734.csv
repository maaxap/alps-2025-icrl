Given that all buttons have been pressed 0 times, we can start by pressing any button. To ensure fairness and systematic exploration, we can choose the buttons in a predefined order, such as alphabetically.

Since our goal is to maximize the total reward over 100 time steps, we need to explore the other buttons to gather more information about their reward distributions.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Current Information:**  
   - The blue button has been pressed once with a reward of 1.0.  
   - All other buttons (green, red, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed yet.

   - **Exploitation:** Choosing the blue button again based on the current highest reward.  
   - **Exploration:** Trying other buttons to gather more information about their potential rewards.  

3. **Strategy:**  
   - Since we have only 100 time steps, we need to balance exploration and exploitation.  
   - At this early stage, exploring other buttons is crucial to avoid missing out on potentially higher rewards.

Given that we are early in the 100 time steps, it is beneficial to balance exploration and exploitation. Since we have already tried the blue and green buttons, the next logical step is to explore one of the untried buttons to gather more information.

2. **Exploration**: The other buttons (yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed yet, so we don’t know their reward distributions. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.

3. **Strategy**: Since we’re early in the 100 time steps (only 3 steps completed), it’s still beneficial to explore. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise. Given that blue and red are tied, we can choose one of them to exploit while keeping exploration in mind for future steps.

Given the current information, the best choice is to **exploit** one of the buttons that has already shown a high reward. Since both blue and red are equally promising, we can choose either. For consistency, let’s choose **blue**.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward so far (1.0), based on 1 press.  
   - The **blue button** has a decent average reward (0.5), based on 2 presses.  

2. **Exploration**:  
   - Buttons like **yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white** have not been pressed yet, so their reward distributions are completely unknown.  

3. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Since we have limited data, it’s important to explore the unknown buttons to understand their potential rewards.  
   - However, we should also continue exploiting the buttons that have shown promise, especially the **red button**, which has the highest reward so far.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given that the **red button** has the highest reward and has only been pressed once, it’s a good candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing an unpressed button to gather more information.  

Since the **red button** has the highest reward and we have only pressed it once, it’s a strong choice for this step. However, to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better buttons, we should also explore.

3. **Decision**: Given that we have 91 time steps remaining, it’s crucial to explore the buttons that have not been pressed yet to gather more information about their potential rewards. However, the **brown button** has shown the highest reward so far, and pressing it again could yield a high reward. But to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better buttons, we should also consider exploring one of the unpressed buttons.

Given the current information, the **brown button** is the most promising for exploitation, but to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing one of the unpressed buttons. Since we have a limited number of time steps, we should prioritize the button with the highest known reward for now and explore the unpressed buttons in subsequent steps.

### Analysis of Past Choices and Rewards:
1. **Brown button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of **1.0**. This is the highest average reward so far, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
2. **Blue and Red buttons**: Both pressed 2 times with an average reward of **0.5**. These are decent options but not as promising as the brown button.
3. **Green, Yellow, Purple, Orange buttons**: Pressed 1 time each with an average reward of **0.0**. These buttons have not shown any reward yet, but they could still have higher means.
4. **Pink, Black, White buttons**: Not pressed yet. These are completely unexplored and could have high rewards.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The brown button has the highest average reward, so pressing it again is a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.
- **Exploration**: The unexplored buttons (pink, black, white) could have higher means, so exploring them is necessary to gather more information.

### Decision:
Given that we have only 100 time steps and need to maximize total reward, we should prioritize **exploitation** of the brown button, as it has the highest proven reward. However, we should also allocate some steps to explore the unexplored buttons to avoid missing out on potentially higher rewards.

For this step, since the brown button has the highest average reward and we have limited information about the other buttons, we will **exploit** the brown button.

3. **Decision**:

   - **Brown** has a good average reward (0.6666) and has been pressed 3 times, making its estimate more reliable.
   - **Black** and **white** have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards.

2. **Number of Trials**: Among these high-performing buttons, **brown** has been pressed the most (4 times), while the others have been pressed fewer times (2 times each). This suggests that **brown** might have a more reliable estimate of its reward distribution.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Since we have 100 time steps and have only used 16 so far, we still have room for exploration. However, given the limited data, it’s reasonable to exploit the buttons that have shown the highest rewards so far.

1. **Average Rewards**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **blue (0.5)**, **red (0.5)**, **brown (0.5)**, **pink (0.5)**, and **black (0.5)**. These buttons seem promising based on their performance.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Since we have only 18 trials out of 100, we are still in the early stages of exploration. It’s important to balance exploiting the buttons that have shown good rewards so far with exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times or not at all.

3. **Under-Explored Buttons**: The **white button** has not been pressed at all, and buttons like **green**, **yellow**, **purple**, and **orange** have been pressed only once. These buttons could potentially have higher rewards but need more exploration.

4. **Strategy**: Given that we are still early in the process, it’s a good idea to explore the **white button** since it hasn’t been tried yet. This aligns with the principle of exploration in bandit algorithms.

### Analysis:
1. **Exploitation**:  
   - Buttons with the highest average reward so far are **blue (0.5)**, **red (0.5)**, **brown (0.5)**, **pink (0.5)**, and **black (0.5)**.  
   - Among these, **brown** has been pressed the most (6 times), but its average reward is still 0.5, which is consistent with the others.  

2. **Exploration**:  
   - Buttons like **green**, **yellow**, **purple**, **orange**, and **white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to bad luck, and they might have higher means.  
   - These buttons are worth exploring further since we have limited information about them.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have 81 time steps left, we can afford to explore more. However, we should also continue exploiting the buttons that have shown good rewards so far.  
   - Let's prioritize exploring buttons that have been pressed only once, as they have the highest uncertainty.  

### Decision:  
Among the buttons pressed only once, **green**, **yellow**, **purple**, **orange**, and **white** are candidates. Since they all have the same level of uncertainty, we can choose any one of them. Let's pick **green** for this step.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **yellow**, **purple**, **orange**, and **white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to chance, and they might have higher true means. Similarly, **green** has been pressed twice with an average reward of 0.0, but it's worth exploring further.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we're only 20 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room to explore. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise but haven't been pressed enough to be confident about their true means.

4. **Decision**: Among the buttons with high average rewards, **brown** has been pressed the most (6 times), so we're relatively confident in its mean. The others (blue, red, pink, black) have only been pressed 2 times each, so there's still uncertainty. To maximize rewards while reducing uncertainty, we should choose one of these less-pressed buttons with high average rewards.

Given this, **blue**, **red**, **pink**, or **black** are good candidates. Since they all have the same average reward and have been pressed equally, we can choose any of them. Let's go with **blue** for simplicity.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration:**
   - **Brown button:** Highest average reward (0.5555) with 9 presses. This is a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Red, Pink, Black buttons:** Average reward of 0.5 with 2 presses each. These are also good candidates but have less certainty due to fewer presses.
   - **Blue button:** Average reward of 0.3333 with 3 presses. Lower than the top candidates but still worth considering.
   - **Green, Yellow, Purple, Orange, White buttons:** Average reward of 0.0 with very few presses. These are candidates for exploration.

2. **Prioritizing Exploration:**
   - Buttons like **Yellow, Purple, Orange, and White** have only been pressed once and have shown no reward. Exploring these could reveal higher rewards.
   - **Green button** has been pressed twice with no reward, but it’s still worth exploring further.

3. **Balancing Act:**
   - Given that we have 76 time steps remaining, we can afford to explore buttons that haven’t been pressed much while still exploiting the best-known options.
   - **Brown button** is the safest bet for exploitation, but exploring **Yellow, Purple, Orange, or White** could yield higher long-term rewards if they turn out to have higher means.

**Decision:**
- **Exploit Brown button** for a guaranteed good reward, or **Explore Yellow, Purple, Orange, or White** to potentially find a better option.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **brown** (average reward: 0.5, pressed 10 times)
   - **red** (average reward: 0.5, pressed 2 times)
   - **pink** (average reward: 0.5, pressed 2 times)
   - **black** (average reward: 0.5, pressed 2 times)

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **orange**, **white**, **green**, **yellow**, and **purple** have been pressed fewer times and have shown low or zero rewards. However, since we don’t have enough data, they could still have higher means.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only 27 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room to explore. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise but haven’t been pressed enough to confirm their true potential.

4. **Decision**: Among the buttons with high average rewards, **red**, **pink**, and **black** have been pressed only twice, which is not enough to confirm their true mean. **Brown** has been pressed 10 times and consistently shows a high reward, but exploring **red**, **pink**, or **black** could yield better long-term results.

Given this, I’ll choose **red** to further explore its potential.

- **Pink button** and **Black button** also have an average reward of 0.5, but they have only been pressed 2 times each, which is a smaller sample size.

3. **Analysis**:
   - **Pink** and **black** have the highest average rewards but have only been pressed twice, so their estimates are less reliable.
   - **Brown** has a slightly lower average reward but has been pressed 11 times, making its estimate more reliable.
   - **Orange** and **white** have been pressed only once and have no rewards yet, so they are worth exploring.

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **black** (average reward: 0.5, pressed 2 times)
   - **brown** (average reward: 0.4545, pressed 11 times)
   - **pink** (average reward: 0.4286, pressed 7 times)

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times and could potentially have higher rewards:
   - **blue** (average reward: 0.3333, pressed 3 times)
   - **red** (average reward: 0.3333, pressed 3 times)
   - **black** (average reward: 0.5, pressed only 2 times)

3. **Decision**: While **brown** and **pink** have good average rewards, they have been pressed many times already. **Black** has the highest average reward but has been pressed only twice, so it’s worth exploring further to confirm its potential.

Given this analysis, the best choice is to press the **black** button to gather more information and potentially maximize rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the buttons with the highest average rewards so far:**
   - **Brown button**: 11 presses, average reward 0.4545
   - **Pink button**: 7 presses, average reward 0.4286
   - **Blue button**: 3 presses, average reward 0.3333
   - **Red button**: 3 presses, average reward 0.3333
   - **Black button**: 3 presses, average reward 0.3333

2. **Evaluate the trade-off between exploration and exploitation:**
   - The **brown button** has the highest average reward (0.4545) and has been pressed 11 times, which is a decent number of trials to estimate its reward distribution.
   - The **pink button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.4286) but has been pressed fewer times (7), so there’s still some uncertainty about its true reward.
   - Buttons like **green, yellow, purple, orange, and white** have been pressed very few times (2 or 1) and have an average reward of 0.0, but this could be due to chance. They might still have higher rewards, so exploring them could be beneficial.

3. **Decision:**
   - Since the **brown button** has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of trials, it’s a safe choice for exploitation.
   - However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should also explore buttons with fewer presses but uncertain rewards.

Given that we’re only 36 time steps in (out of 100), there’s still room for exploration. However, the **brown button** has shown the most promise so far.

   - **Green, yellow, purple, orange, and white buttons** have an average reward of 0.0, but they have been pressed very few times (1-2 times), so they could still have higher rewards.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   - Since we have 63 remaining time steps, we can afford to explore buttons that have been pressed fewer times to better understand their reward distributions.  
   - **White button** has only been pressed once, so it’s a good candidate for exploration to gather more data.  

3. **Final Decision**:

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance exploration (trying buttons with fewer presses to estimate their true reward) and exploitation (pressing buttons that have shown higher rewards so far).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify High-Reward Buttons**:  
   - **Brown button** has the highest average reward (0.5625) with 16 presses.  
   - **Pink button** has a decent average reward (0.42857142857142855) with 7 presses.  

2. **Evaluate Exploration Needs**:  
   - Buttons like **yellow**, **purple**, **orange**, and **white** have been pressed only 2 times each and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons might have higher true rewards but need more exploration.  
   - Buttons like **blue**, **green**, **red**, and **black** have been pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.3333333333333333. They are moderately explored but not as promising as **brown** or **pink**.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Brown** is the most promising button based on current data, but it has already been pressed 16 times. Further exploration of under-pressed buttons could reveal better options.  
   - **Pink** is a good balance between exploitation and exploration, as it has a decent reward and fewer presses compared to **brown**.  
   - **Yellow**, **purple**, **orange**, and **white** are worth exploring, but their average reward of 0.0 so far makes them less attractive unless we suspect their true reward is higher.  

Given the current data, **brown** remains the best choice for exploitation, but to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should also consider exploring under-pressed buttons. However, since **brown** has the highest reward so far, it’s the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Evaluate under-explored buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **yellow**, **purple**, **orange**, and **white** have been pressed only 2 times each and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons could potentially have higher rewards but need more exploration.  

3. **Balance exploration and exploitation**:  
   - Since we’re only 44 time steps in (out of 100), there’s still room for exploration. However, exploiting the **brown button** (highest reward so far) is a safe choice to maximize immediate rewards.  
   - Alternatively, exploring **yellow**, **purple**, **orange**, or **white** could reveal a better option, but it’s riskier.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Given the current data, the **brown button** is the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward. However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should occasionally explore under-pressed buttons.  

Since the **brown button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be somewhat reliable, it’s the best choice for now.

   The **brown button** has consistently shown the highest average reward, so it’s a safe choice for exploitation.  

3. **Exploring Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   Buttons like **purple**, **orange**, and **white** have been pressed very few times and have not yielded any rewards yet. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards, but the risk is higher.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Given that we have 50 more time steps, it’s reasonable to continue exploiting the **brown button** for now, as it has the highest proven reward. However, we should also allocate some steps to explore under-explored buttons like **purple**, **orange**, or **white** to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options.  

For this step, let’s prioritize exploitation to maximize immediate rewards:

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only 51 time steps in (with 49 remaining), we still have room for exploration. However, the **brown button** has consistently performed well, making it a safer choice for now.

   - **Blue, green, red, yellow, black buttons**: All have an average reward of 0.3333 with 3 presses each. These are moderate but not as promising as brown.  
   - **Purple, orange, white buttons**: Average reward of 0.0 with 2 presses each. These seem unpromising but could still be worth exploring.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   Since we’re only at 58 time steps out of 100, there’s still room for exploration. However, the **brown button** has a clear lead in terms of reward, and pressing it again is likely to yield a higher reward than exploring buttons with low or zero rewards.

4. **Decision**:  
   Given the brown button’s strong performance and the need to maximize rewards, it’s the best choice for now.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the best-performing buttons so far**:  
   - **Brown button** has the highest average reward (0.4666666666666667) and has been pressed 30 times.  
   - **Pink button** has the second-highest average reward (0.375) and has been pressed 8 times.  

2. **Consider under-explored buttons**:  
   - **Purple, orange, and white buttons** have been pressed only 2 times each and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons could potentially have higher rewards but need more exploration.  

3. **Evaluate the trade-off**:  
   - Pressing the **brown button** again is a safe choice for exploitation, as it has consistently provided a high reward.  
   - Exploring **purple, orange, or white buttons** could reveal higher rewards, but it’s riskier since their average reward is currently 0.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Given that we still have 41 time steps left (100 - 59 = 41), we can afford to explore under-explored buttons while also exploiting the best-performing ones. However, since the **brown button** has consistently performed well and has a higher average reward than the others, it’s the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

1. **Exploitation**: The **brown button** has the highest average reward (0.48387) and has been pressed 31 times, indicating it’s a reliable choice.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The **brown button** has the highest average reward (0.459459) with 37 presses. This suggests it might be the best option so far.

2. **Exploration Needed**: Buttons like **purple**, **orange**, and **white** have been pressed only 2 times each and have an average reward of 0.0. This could be due to bad luck, or they might genuinely have low rewards. We should explore these buttons further to confirm their true reward.

3. **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation**: Since we have 34 time steps left (100 - 66), we can afford to explore a bit more. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown potential or have been under-explored.

4. **Decision**: Given the brown button's strong performance and the need to explore under-pressed buttons, we'll prioritize **exploitation** for now but keep an eye on exploration in future steps.

### Analysis:
1. **Brown button**: Has the highest average reward (0.4615) and has been pressed 39 times. This is the most reliable choice for exploitation.
2. **Pink button**: Has a decent average reward (0.375) and has been pressed only 8 times. It could be a good candidate for further exploration.
3. **Blue, Green, Red, Yellow, Black buttons**: All have the same average reward (0.3333) and have been pressed 3 times each. These are moderate options but less promising than brown or pink.
4. **Purple, Orange, White buttons**: Have an average reward of 0.0 and have been pressed 3, 2, and 2 times respectively. These seem less promising but could still be explored further.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The brown button is the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.
- **Exploration**: The pink button has a good average reward but fewer presses, so exploring it further could yield better long-term results.

Given that we have 31 time steps left (100 - 69 = 31), we should prioritize exploitation to maximize rewards while still leaving some room for exploration.

### Decision:
Since the **brown button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, it is the best choice for exploitation at this stage.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Brown button** has the highest average reward (0.45) and has been pressed 40 times, indicating a reliable estimate.  
   - **Pink button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.375) but has been pressed only 8 times, suggesting it might have more potential if explored further.  
   - Buttons like **purple**, **orange**, and **white** have an average reward of 0.0 but have been pressed very few times (2-3 times), so they could still have higher rewards if explored.  

2. **Prioritizing High-Reward Buttons**:  
   - The **brown button** is the most reliable choice for immediate high rewards, given its consistent performance.  

3. **Exploring Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **purple**, **orange**, and **white** have been pressed very few times and could potentially yield higher rewards if their true means are higher than currently observed.  

4. **Balancing Act**:  
   - Since we have 30 time steps left, we should focus on exploiting the **brown button** for most of the remaining steps while allocating a few steps to explore under-explored buttons.

   - **Pink button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.375) but with only 8 presses, it could still have potential.  
   - Other buttons like **blue, green, red, yellow, black** have similar average rewards (0.3333) but with fewer presses, so they might be worth exploring further.  
   - Buttons like **purple, orange, white** have shown 0.0 average rewards, making them less attractive unless we want to explore them further.

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Since **brown** has the highest average reward and a significant number of presses, it’s a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - However, we should also consider exploring **pink** further, as it has a decent average reward but fewer presses compared to **brown**.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the remaining 26 time steps, it’s prudent to continue exploiting **brown** while occasionally exploring **pink** or other buttons with fewer presses but decent potential.  

For this step, **brown** remains the best choice for maximizing immediate reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Brown button** has the highest average reward (0.4222) and has been pressed 45 times, indicating a relatively reliable estimate.  
   - **Pink button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.375) but has been pressed only 8 times, suggesting it might have more potential if explored further.  
   - Buttons like **purple**, **orange**, and **white** have an average reward of 0.0 but have been pressed very few times (3, 2, and 2 respectively), so they could still yield higher rewards if explored.  

2. **Prioritizing High-Reward Buttons**:  
   - The **brown button** is the most reliable choice for immediate reward, given its high average and sufficient exploration.  

3. **Exploring Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **purple**, **orange**, and **white** have not been explored enough to rule them out completely. However, given the limited time steps remaining (25), focusing on buttons with proven higher rewards is more strategic.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the goal of maximizing total reward, the **brown button** is the best choice due to its consistently high average reward and sufficient exploration.

### Analysis:
1. **Brown button**: Has the highest average reward (0.413) and has been pressed 46 times. This is the most exploited button so far.
2. **Pink button**: Has a decent average reward (0.375) and has been pressed only 8 times. It could be a good candidate for further exploration.
3. **Blue, Green, Red, Yellow, Black buttons**: All have the same average reward (0.333) and have been pressed only 3 times each. These are also candidates for exploration.
4. **Purple, Orange, White buttons**: Have an average reward of 0.0 and have been pressed 3, 2, and 2 times respectively. These seem less promising but still need some exploration to confirm their low reward.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The brown button is the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.
- **Exploration**: The pink button has a good average reward but fewer presses, so it’s worth exploring further. The blue, green, red, yellow, and black buttons also need more exploration to confirm their reward potential.

### Decision:
Given that we have only 24 time steps left (100 - 76 = 24), we should prioritize buttons with higher potential rewards but fewer presses. The **pink button** is a good balance between exploration and exploitation, as it has a decent average reward and fewer presses compared to the brown button.

1. **Average Rewards**:

   - Buttons purple, orange, and white have an average reward of 0.0, making them less attractive.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The brown button has been pressed the most (47 times), so its reward estimate is relatively stable.  
   - Buttons like purple, orange, and white have been pressed fewer times (2-3 times), so there is higher uncertainty in their true reward values. However, their current average reward is 0.0, making them less promising.  
   - Buttons blue, green, red, yellow, pink, and black have been pressed 3-9 times, and their average rewards are the same. There is still some uncertainty in their true reward values, but they are not as well-explored as brown.

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the remaining 22 time steps, the **brown button** is the best choice because it has the highest average reward and a relatively stable estimate.  
   - Exploring other buttons with lower average rewards or zero rewards is unlikely to yield better results.

   - The **brown button** has the highest average reward of **0.4117647058823529** after being pressed 51 times.  
   - All other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, pink, black) have the same average reward of **0.3333333333333333**, but they have been pressed only 3 times each, so their true means are less certain.  
   - The purple, orange, and white buttons have an average reward of **0.0**, indicating they are likely not good choices.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - We have only 18 time steps left (100 - 82 = 18).  
   - The brown button has been pressed the most and has the highest average reward, so it is the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
   - Exploring other buttons (e.g., blue, green, red, yellow, pink, black) might reveal higher rewards, but with limited time, the risk may not be worth it.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The **brown button** is the best choice given its high average reward and the limited time remaining.

1. **Brown Button**: It has the highest average reward (0.4038) and has been pressed 52 times, which gives us a relatively reliable estimate of its mean. This is a strong candidate.

2. **Other Buttons**: 
   - **Blue, Green, Red, Yellow, Pink, Black**: These buttons have been pressed 3 times each and have the same average reward of 0.3333. While this is lower than the brown button, they have been pressed fewer times, so there is more uncertainty about their true means.
   - **Purple, Orange, White**: These buttons have been pressed 2-3 times and have an average reward of 0.0. Given the low average reward and the small number of trials, they are less promising.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Since we have only 17 time steps left (100 - 83 = 17), we should focus more on exploitation (choosing the button with the highest known reward) rather than exploration (trying buttons with uncertain rewards).

Given this analysis, the **brown button** is the best choice to maximize the total reward.
