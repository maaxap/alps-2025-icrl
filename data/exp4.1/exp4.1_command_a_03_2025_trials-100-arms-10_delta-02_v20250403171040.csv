2. **Exploration**: The other buttons (yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed yet, so we don’t know their reward distributions. Pressing one of these could reveal a button with a higher average reward.
3. **Current Strategy**: Since we’ve only pressed 3 buttons out of 10 and have 97 time steps left, it’s still early in the process. We should prioritize exploration to gather more information about the buttons.

Exploration involves trying out buttons that haven't been pressed yet to gather more information about their reward distributions. Exploitation involves pressing buttons that have already shown promising rewards to maximize immediate gains.

From the summary:
- **Blue** and **Yellow** buttons have been pressed once each and both yielded a reward of 1.0. These are the most promising buttons so far.
- **Green** and **Red** buttons have been pressed once each and both yielded a reward of 0.0. These buttons seem less promising based on the initial data.
- The remaining buttons (**Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink, Black, White**) have not been pressed yet, so we have no information about their rewards.

Given that we have only 4 time steps of data and 6 buttons remain unexplored, it's a good strategy to explore one of the unexplored buttons to gather more information. However, since **Blue** and **Yellow** have shown the highest rewards so far, it's also reasonable to exploit one of them to maximize immediate reward.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**: With only 4 data points, exploration is still crucial to understand the reward distributions of all buttons.
2. **Promising Buttons**: Blue and Yellow are the most promising based on current data.
3. **Unexplored Buttons**: Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink, Black, and White are unexplored and could potentially yield higher rewards.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **orange** and **brown**, both with an average reward of 1.0. However, each has only been pressed once, so their true reward distributions are still uncertain.

2. **Exploration**: The buttons **pink**, **black**, and **white** have not been pressed at all, so their reward distributions are completely unknown. Exploring these buttons could potentially reveal higher rewards.

3. **Current Best Known Option**: The **blue** button has been pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.6666666666666666, which is a relatively stable and decent reward.

4. **Strategy**: Given that we have only 100 time steps, it’s important to explore the unknown buttons early to gather more information. However, since **orange** and **brown** have shown the highest rewards so far, it’s also important to exploit them to maximize immediate rewards.

**Decision**: Since **orange** and **brown** have the highest average rewards but have only been pressed once, it’s a good idea to press one of them again to confirm their high reward potential. Between the two, we can choose either, but for consistency, let’s choose **orange**.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.6666666666666666) based on 3 presses. This suggests it might be a good choice to maximize immediate reward.  
2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **pink**, **black**, and **white** have not been pressed at all, so we don't know their potential rewards. However, since we only have 100 time steps, we need to prioritize buttons that have shown some promise or have high uncertainty.  
3. **Uncertainty**: The **brown button** has only been pressed once and has an average reward of 1.0, which is the highest observed reward so far. However, this is based on very little data, so it might be worth pressing it again to confirm its potential.  

Given the current data, the **blue button** is the most reliable choice for exploitation, but the **brown button** has the highest observed reward (though with high uncertainty).

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.6667. This is the highest average reward so far, indicating it might be the best option.
2. **Yellow, Orange, Brown Buttons**: Each pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. These buttons have shown moderate success but need more exploration.
3. **Green, Red, Purple Buttons**: Each pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not yielded any reward yet, but they could still be promising since they have only been pressed once.
4. **Pink, Black, White Buttons**: Not pressed yet. These buttons are completely unexplored and could potentially have high rewards.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The blue button has the highest average reward, so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
- **Exploration**: The unexplored buttons (pink, black, white) need to be tested to gather more information.

### Decision:
Given that we are early in the 100 time steps (only 12 steps completed), it’s important to balance exploitation and exploration. However, since the blue button has shown the highest reward so far, it’s a good choice to maximize immediate reward while we continue to explore other buttons in subsequent steps.

This is a classic exploration-exploitation dilemma in bandit problems.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The blue button has the highest average reward (0.75) based on 4 presses. This suggests that pressing the blue button again is likely to yield a good reward.
   
2. **Exploration**: Several buttons (pink, black, white) have not been pressed at all, and others (green, red, purple) have been pressed only once with no reward. These buttons could potentially have higher rewards, but we don’t have enough information yet.

3. **Strategy**: Given that we are only 13 time steps into the 100 available, it’s still early to focus solely on exploitation. We should continue to explore buttons that have not been pressed or have been pressed very few times to gather more information.

4. **Decision**: Since the blue button has the highest average reward, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing one of the unexplored buttons (pink, black, white) or those with very few presses (green, red, purple).

Given the current data, the **blue button** remains the most promising choice for exploitation, but to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better options, we should also explore. Since pink, black, and white have not been pressed at all, let’s choose one of them for exploration.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.5714) and has been pressed 7 times, indicating it’s a reliable choice so far.  
2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **green, red, purple, pink,** and **white** have been pressed very few times (or not at all) and have shown low or no rewards. However, their true potential is still unknown.  
3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only 19 time steps in (out of 100), there’s still ample time to explore. However, the **blue button** is currently the best-performing option, and pressing it again will likely yield a good reward.  

Given the current data, the **blue button** is the safest and most rewarding choice at this stage. However, to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better buttons, we should also consider exploring the **white button**, which hasn’t been pressed at all yet.

**Final Decision**: Since the **blue button** has the highest average reward and we’re still early in the process, it’s a good choice to maximize immediate rewards while we continue to explore other buttons in future steps.

   - Other buttons (e.g., green, red, purple, pink) have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, but this could be due to insufficient exploration.  

2. **Uncertainty in Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like green, red, purple, and pink have only been pressed once, so their true reward distributions are highly uncertain.  
   - Buttons like yellow, orange, brown, black, and white have been pressed 2 times each and have an average reward of 0.5, which is lower than blue but still worth considering for exploration.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have 77 remaining time steps, we can afford to explore under-explored buttons while still exploiting the blue button.  
   - However, given the blue button's strong performance so far, it remains the best choice for immediate reward maximization.

   - The **blue button** has been pressed 13 times with an average reward of 0.4615, which is the highest average reward among all buttons. However, it has been pressed significantly more than the others, so its average reward might be more reliable.  
   - The **yellow, orange, brown, black, and white buttons** have been pressed only 2 times each and have an average reward of 0.5, which is higher than the blue button. However, this average is based on very few samples, so it might not be reliable.  
   - The **green, red, purple, and pink buttons** have been pressed only 1 time each and have an average reward of 0.0, but this is based on just one sample, so it’s too early to conclude they are bad choices.

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we have 73 remaining time steps, it’s still early in the game, and we should prioritize exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information. The buttons with only 1 or 2 presses are good candidates for exploration.

3. **Choosing the Next Button**:  
   - The **green, red, purple, and pink buttons** have the least data (only 1 press each), so exploring one of these would be a good strategy.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.4615) and has been pressed the most (13 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice.  
2. **Exploration**: Several buttons (red, purple, pink) have been pressed only once or twice and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to chance, and they might have higher true means.  
3. **High-reward alternatives**: Buttons like yellow, orange, brown, black, and white have been pressed 2 times each and have a perfect average reward of 0.5. These are promising candidates but need more exploration to confirm their true means.  

Given the current data:
- The **blue button** is the safest choice for exploitation.  
- Buttons like **yellow, orange, brown, black, and white** are worth exploring further due to their high average rewards, but they have limited data.  

Since we’re only 28 time steps in (out of 100), it’s still early to focus solely on exploitation. Let’s explore one of the high-reward buttons with limited data to gather more information.

1. **Exploitation Candidates**:  
   - The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **orange**, **brown**, **black**, and **white**, each with an average reward of **0.5**.  
   - However, these buttons have only been pressed **2 times** each, so their reward estimates are still uncertain.  

2. **Exploration Candidates**:  
   - Buttons like **green**, **red**, **purple**, and **pink** have been pressed **1-2 times** and have an average reward of **0.0**, but this could be due to chance. They might still have higher true means.  
   - **Yellow** has been pressed **3 times** with an average reward of **0.3333**, which is lower than the top candidates but still worth exploring further.  

3. **Blue Button**:  
   - **Blue** has been pressed **13 times** with an average reward of **0.4615**. While this is a decent reward, pressing it again might not yield as much new information compared to exploring other buttons.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Since **orange**, **brown**, **black**, and **white** have the highest average rewards so far but have been pressed only twice, it’s a good idea to exploit one of them to confirm their high reward potential.  
   - Among these, **orange** is a reasonable choice as it has the same average reward as the others but hasn’t been pressed more than the rest.

Similarly, **green**, **brown**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed 2 times each, and while some have shown potential (e.g., **brown**, **black**, **white** with 0.5 average), they could still yield higher rewards.

3. **Strategy**: Given that we have 64 remaining time steps, we should prioritize buttons with high rewards but also explore under-pressed buttons to avoid missing out on potentially better options.

**Decision**: The **orange button** is the most promising for exploitation, but we should also explore under-pressed buttons like **red**, **purple**, or **pink** to gather more data. Since **orange** has already shown strong performance, it’s a safe and rewarding choice for now.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Orange button** has the highest average reward (0.6) and has been pressed 10 times, which is a decent number of trials to trust its average.  
   - **Blue button** has the second-highest average reward (0.4615) and has been pressed 13 times, indicating a reliable estimate.  
   - **Brown, black, and white buttons** have an average reward of 0.5 but have only been pressed 2 times each, so their true potential is still uncertain.  
   - **Green, red, purple, and pink buttons** have an average reward of 0.0 but have been pressed very few times (1-2 times), so they could still be worth exploring.  

2. **Prioritizing Actions**:  
   - **Orange button** is the best choice for exploitation since it has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of trials.  
   - **Exploration** should focus on buttons with high uncertainty (e.g., green, red, purple, pink) but since their average rewards are 0.0, they are less promising unless we suspect their true means are higher.  

3. **Decision**:  
   Given the current data, the **orange button** is the most promising choice for maximizing immediate reward. Exploring other buttons with low average rewards and few trials (like green, red, purple, pink) is risky and less likely to yield a higher reward.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **green, red, purple, pink** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have an average reward of 0.0, but this could be due to chance. They might have higher true means that we haven’t discovered yet.

3. **Strategy**: Since we’re only 38 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room for exploration. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise but haven’t been fully explored. The **orange** button has the highest average reward so far, but **brown, black, and white** also look promising with their limited data.

4. **Decision**: Given the high average reward of **orange** and its relatively higher number of presses compared to **brown, black, and white**, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider **brown, black, or white** since they have fewer data points but high average rewards.

Given the current data, **orange** is the most reliable choice for exploitation, but **brown** is a good candidate for exploration with its high average reward and fewer presses.

   - **Blue** has a moderate average reward (0.4615) with 13 presses.  

2. **Consider under-explored buttons**:  
   - **Red**, **Purple**, and **Pink** have been pressed only once, all with 0 reward, but this could be due to chance.  
   - **Green**, **Black**, and **White** have been pressed 2–3 times, with mixed results.  

3. **Balance exploration and exploitation**:  
   - **Brown** is the most promising for exploitation, but it has only been pressed 7 times, so its reward distribution is still uncertain.  
   - **Orange** is a strong contender but has been pressed more than **Brown**.  
   - **Blue** is moderately rewarding but has been pressed the most.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - **Brown** has the highest average reward and fewer presses compared to **Orange** and **Blue**, making it a good choice for exploitation while still leaving room for exploration if needed.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **brown**: 0.625 (pressed 8 times)
   - **orange**: 0.5 (pressed 12 times)
   - **blue**: 0.46153846153846156 (pressed 13 times)
   - **black**: 0.5 (pressed 2 times)
   - **white**: 0.5 (pressed 2 times)

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times and have shown no reward yet, which means they could potentially have high rewards:
   - **green**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)
   - **red**: 0.0 (pressed 1 time)
   - **purple**: 0.0 (pressed 1 time)
   - **pink**: 0.0 (pressed 1 time)

3. **Decision**: Given that we have 55 time steps remaining, it’s still worth exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially high-reward buttons. However, we should also continue to exploit the buttons that have shown good rewards so far.

**Strategy**: Prioritize buttons with high average rewards but also allocate some presses to under-explored buttons.

**Next Choice**: The **brown** button has the highest average reward (0.625) and has been pressed a moderate number of times (8), making it a good candidate for exploitation. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing one of the under-explored buttons with zero rewards, like **red**, **purple**, or **pink**.

Given the current data, **brown** seems like the best choice for exploitation, but let’s also consider the potential of **red** for exploration since it has only been pressed once.

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **brown** (average reward: 0.5555555555555556, pressed 9 times)
   - **orange** (average reward: 0.5, pressed 12 times)

   - **red** (pressed 1 time, average reward: 0.0)
   - **purple** (pressed 1 time, average reward: 0.0)
   - **pink** (pressed 1 time, average reward: 0.0)

3. **Decision**: Given that we have 54 time steps remaining, it’s still worth exploring buttons with fewer presses to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially high-reward buttons. However, we should also continue exploiting the buttons that have shown good results so far.

   - **brown** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **black** and **white** have high average rewards but have been pressed very few times, so they are also worth exploring further.

4. **Final Choice**: Since **brown** has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to suggest reliability, it’s a good choice for exploitation. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider **black** or **white** as they have high potential but fewer presses.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 13 times with an average reward of 0.4615. This is a solid performer but not the highest.
2. **Orange Button**: Pressed 12 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is the highest average reward so far.
3. **Brown Button**: Pressed 10 times with an average reward of 0.5. Tied with orange for the highest average reward.
4. **Black and White Buttons**: Both pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. These buttons have high potential but need more exploration.
5. **Green, Red, Purple, Pink Buttons**: Pressed 1-2 times with average rewards of 0.0. These buttons have not shown any reward yet but could still be worth exploring.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: Focus on buttons with the highest average rewards (orange and brown).
- **Exploration**: Test buttons with fewer presses and high potential (black and white) or those that haven't shown rewards yet (green, red, purple, pink).

### Decision:
Given that **orange** and **brown** have the highest average rewards so far, and **black** and **white** have high potential with limited data, we should prioritize these buttons. However, since **orange** and **brown** are already well-explored, we should also consider exploring **black** or **white** to gather more data.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward (0.5333) and has been pressed 15 times, indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Brown** has a slightly lower average reward (0.5) but has been pressed 10 times, making it another good candidate.  
   - **Blue** has a lower average reward (0.4615) but has been pressed 13 times, so it’s less attractive compared to orange and brown.  

2. **Under-explored Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **green**, **red**, **purple**, and **pink** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have an average reward of 0.0. However, their low average could be due to insufficient exploration.  
   - Buttons like **yellow**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.3333, which is lower than orange and brown but could still be worth exploring further.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given that **orange** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a reasonable number of times, it’s a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should also consider exploring under-explored buttons with low average rewards, as their true potential is still unknown.  

Since **orange** has the highest average reward and has been sufficiently explored, it’s the best choice for maximizing immediate reward.

   - **Blue**: 0.4615 (pressed 13 times)
   - **Brown**: 0.5 (pressed 10 times)

2. **Exploration**: Buttons that have been pressed very few times (1-3 times) and have an average reward of 0.0 could potentially have higher rewards if explored further:
   - **Green**, **Red**, **Purple**, **Pink**

3. **Current Strategy**: Given that we have 47 time steps remaining (100 - 53), we should prioritize exploiting the buttons with the highest known rewards while still exploring the under-explored buttons to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better options.

4. **Decision**: 
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Green**, **Red**, **Purple**, and **Pink** have been pressed very few times and have an average reward of 0.0, but they could still yield higher rewards if explored further.

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, and considering the remaining time steps, the best choice is to **exploit the button with the highest known reward** while keeping in mind the need to explore under-explored buttons in subsequent steps.

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   - Buttons like **green, red, purple, pink** have been pressed very few times, so exploring them could yield valuable information. However, given their current average reward of 0.0, they are riskier choices.  

3. **Balancing Risk and Reward**:  
   - **Orange** is the safest choice for exploitation, given its high average reward and sufficient data.  
   - **Brown** is a good balance between exploitation and exploration, as it has a high reward but fewer presses.

From the summary:

- **Orange** and **Brown** buttons have the highest average rewards (0.5) and have been pressed a moderate number of times (22 and 10, respectively). These are strong candidates for exploitation.
- **Blue** button has a slightly lower average reward (0.4615) but has been pressed 13 times, indicating a decent amount of exploration.
- **Red**, **Purple**, and **Pink** buttons have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons need more exploration to determine their true potential.
- **Green**, **Yellow**, **Black**, and **White** buttons have been pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.3333. These buttons also need more exploration.

Given that we have 40 time steps remaining, it's important to continue exploring the less-pressed buttons while still exploiting the high-reward buttons. However, since **Orange** and **Brown** have already shown consistent high rewards and have been pressed a fair number of times, it's reasonable to continue exploiting them.

**Orange** has a slightly higher number of presses compared to **Brown**, but both have the same average reward. To balance exploration and exploitation, we can choose **Brown** next, as it has been pressed fewer times than **Orange** but still has a high average reward.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Orange button** has the highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed 22 times, indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Blue button** has the second-highest average reward (0.4615) and has been pressed 13 times, making it another good candidate.  
   - **Brown button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.4545) but has been pressed 11 times, so it’s also worth considering.  

2. **Under-explored Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **red**, **purple**, and **pink** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to bad luck, and they might have higher true means.  
   - Buttons like **green**, **yellow**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed 3 times each and have the same average reward (0.3333). These could also benefit from further exploration.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given that we have 39 time steps remaining, we should prioritize exploiting the buttons with the highest known rewards while still exploring under-explored buttons to avoid missing out on potentially better options.  
   - **Orange** is the best-performing button so far, and pressing it again is a safe choice for exploitation.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Orange button**: Highest average reward (0.478) with 23 presses.  
2. **Blue button**: Second-highest average reward (0.462) with 13 presses.  
3. **Brown button**: Third-highest average reward (0.455) with 11 presses.  
4. **Green, Yellow, Black, White buttons**: Similar average rewards (0.333) with only 3 presses each.  
5. **Red, Purple, Pink buttons**: No rewards yet, but only pressed once.  

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: Focus on buttons with high average rewards (orange, blue, brown).  
- **Exploration**: Test buttons with low sample counts (red, purple, pink) to see if they might yield higher rewards.  

### Decision:
- **Orange** is the best-performing button so far, but it has been pressed 23 times already. Further exploration might reveal better options.  
- **Red, Purple, Pink** have only been pressed once and have no rewards. They are worth exploring to see if they can outperform the current leaders.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Orange**: 0.47826 (pressed 23 times)
   - **Blue**: 0.46154 (pressed 13 times)
   - **Brown**: 0.45455 (pressed 11 times)

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times and could potentially have higher rewards than their current averages suggest:
   - **Red**: 0.0 (pressed 1 time)
   - **Purple**: 0.0 (pressed 1 time)
   - **Pink**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)

3. **Decision**: Given that we have 37 time steps remaining (100 - 63), we should prioritize **exploitation** to maximize rewards while still leaving some room for exploration. The **orange button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, making it a strong candidate.

However, to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better buttons, we should also explore the least-pressed buttons with low rewards, as their true means might be higher than their current averages. Among these, **Red**, **Purple**, and **Pink** are the least explored.

4. **Final Choice**: Since **Orange** has the highest average reward and is a safe bet for exploitation, we’ll choose it next. However, if we were to explore, **Red** or **Purple** would be the next candidates due to their minimal exploration.

Given the goal of maximizing rewards, the best choice is:

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Orange button**: Highest average reward (0.5185) with 27 presses. This is the most promising button so far.
2. **Blue button**: Second-highest average reward (0.4615) with 13 presses. A strong contender.
3. **Brown button**: Third-highest average reward (0.4545) with 11 presses. Also a good option.
4. **Green, yellow, black, white buttons**: Similar average rewards (0.3333) with only 3 presses each. These buttons need more exploration.
5. **Red, purple, pink buttons**: Average reward of 0.0 with very few presses (1-2). These buttons are underexplored and could potentially yield higher rewards.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: Focus on the orange button, as it has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of presses.
- **Exploration**: Allocate some presses to underexplored buttons (red, purple, pink) to gather more data.

### Decision:
Given that the orange button has the highest average reward and a good number of presses, it is the best choice for exploitation. However, we should also explore the underexplored buttons to ensure we are not missing out on potentially better options.

Since the orange button is the most promising and has been pressed 27 times, it is a safe and optimal choice for this step.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **orange button** has the highest average reward (0.5357) and has been pressed 28 times, indicating a reliable track record. It’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red**, **purple**, and **pink** have been pressed very few times (1, 1, and 2 times, respectively) and have an average reward of 0.0. However, their low average could be due to insufficient data. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.  
3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re at time step 69 out of 100, we still have some room for exploration, but exploitation becomes more critical as we approach the end.  

Given the current data:
- **Orange** is the best exploitative choice.  
- **Red**, **purple**, and **pink** are worth exploring, but their low averages make them riskier.  

Since **orange** has consistently performed well and we’re closer to the end of the 100 time steps, it’s safer to exploit it for now.

   - **Orange**: 0.5 (pressed 34 times)
   - **Blue**: 0.4615 (pressed 13 times)
   - **Brown**: 0.4545 (pressed 11 times)

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red**, **purple**, and **pink** have been pressed very few times (2, 1, and 2 times respectively) and have an average reward of 0.0. However, their true reward potential is still uncertain due to the small sample size.

3. **Decision**: Given that we have only 25 time steps left, the priority should be on exploiting the buttons with the highest known rewards to maximize immediate gains. Among these, **orange** has the highest average reward and a relatively large sample size, making it a reliable choice.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Orange**: 0.4857 (pressed 35 times)
   - **Blue**: 0.4615 (pressed 13 times)

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times or not at all, and their true reward potential is still uncertain:
   - **Purple**: pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0
   - **Red**: pressed 2 times, average reward 0.0
   - **Pink**: pressed 2 times, average reward 0.0

3. **Current Strategy**: Since we have only 24 time steps left (100 - 76 = 24), we should focus more on **exploitation** while still exploring a bit to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better buttons.

4. **Decision**: The **orange** button has the highest average reward and has been pressed a reasonable number of times, making it a reliable choice. However, we should also explore **purple**, **red**, or **pink** to confirm their low rewards.

Given the limited time and the need to maximize rewards, the best choice is to **exploit** the button with the highest known reward while leaving some room for exploration in the remaining steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward (0.486486) and has been pressed 37 times, indicating it’s a reliable choice.  
   - **Blue** has a slightly lower average reward (0.461538) but has been pressed only 13 times, so it might still have potential.  
   - Other buttons like **brown** (0.454545) and **green/yellow/black/white** (0.333333) have lower average rewards but fewer presses, so they could be worth exploring.  

2. **Under-explored Buttons**:  
   - **Red**, **purple**, and **pink** have been pressed very few times (2, 1, and 2 respectively) and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons are highly uncertain and could potentially yield higher rewards if explored further.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have 22 time steps left, we should focus on exploiting the best-known button while allocating a few trials to under-explored buttons.  
   - **Orange** is the best-known button, but we should also explore **red**, **purple**, and **pink** to ensure we’re not missing out on higher rewards.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - For this step, **orange** remains the safest choice for exploitation.  
   - However, to balance exploration, we could allocate a few trials to **red**, **purple**, or **pink**.  

Given the remaining time steps and the need to maximize rewards, the best choice is to exploit the **orange** button while keeping an eye on under-explored options.

   - **Red**, **purple**, and **pink** have been pressed very few times (2, 1, and 2 respectively) and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons could have higher true rewards but need more exploration.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 18 time steps left, we should focus on exploiting the best-known buttons while allocating a few trials to under-explored buttons with potential.  
   - **Orange** is the safest choice for exploitation, but **blue** is close in reward and less explored, making it a good candidate for further investigation.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high average reward of **orange** and its reliability, it’s the best choice for exploitation.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward (0.47619) and has been pressed 42 times, indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Blue** has a slightly lower average reward (0.46154) but has been pressed only 13 times, suggesting it might still have potential.  
   - Other buttons like **brown** (0.45455) and **green**, **yellow**, **black**, **white** (all 0.33333) have lower average rewards but fewer presses, so they could still be worth exploring.  

2. **Under-explored Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **red**, **purple**, and **pink** have very low or zero average rewards but have been pressed only 1-2 times. They could still have higher rewards, so exploring them might be beneficial.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have 17 time steps left, we should focus on exploiting the best-known button while allocating a few steps to explore under-explored buttons.  
   - **Orange** is the best-known button, so it’s a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - **Red**, **purple**, and **pink** are worth exploring, but since they have shown no reward so far, they are riskier choices.  

Given the above analysis, the best choice is to **exploit the orange button** for now, as it has the highest known reward and is a safer bet to maximize the total reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Orange** and **Blue** buttons have the highest average rewards (0.4651 and 0.4615, respectively) and have been pressed frequently (43 and 13 times, respectively). These are strong candidates for exploitation.  
   - Buttons like **Red**, **Pink**, and **Purple** have been pressed very few times (2, 2, and 1 times, respectively) and have shown 0 average reward. However, their low sample size means their true reward potential is still uncertain.  

2. **Current Best Performers**:  
   - **Orange** has a slightly higher average reward than **Blue** and has been pressed more times, indicating consistent performance.  
   - **Brown** also has a decent average reward (0.4545) but has been pressed fewer times (11) compared to **Orange** and **Blue**.  

3. **Exploration Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 16 time steps left (100 - 84 = 16), we should focus more on exploiting the best-performing buttons rather than exploring buttons with low or zero rewards.  
   - However, buttons like **Green**, **Yellow**, **Black**, and **White** have moderate average rewards (0.3333) and have been pressed only 3 times each. They could still be worth exploring if we have extra time steps, but given the limited time, it’s better to stick with the top performers.  

4. **Final Decision**:  
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward and has been consistently pressed, making it the safest and most rewarding choice for the remaining time steps.

   - **Orange**: 0.4545 (second-highest average reward)  
   - **Brown**: 0.4545 (same as orange)  
   - All other buttons have lower average rewards or insufficient data (e.g., red, pink, purple with 0.0 average).

2. **Consider the number of trials**:  
   - Blue has been pressed 13 times, which is a reasonable sample size.  
   - Orange has been pressed 44 times, providing a robust estimate of its average reward.  
   - Brown has been pressed 11 times, also a decent sample size.  

3. **Compare the top contenders**:  
   - Blue has a slightly higher average reward (0.4615) compared to orange and brown (0.4545).  
   - While orange has more trials, the difference in average reward is small, and blue’s higher average makes it a better choice.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Orange Button**:  
   - Pressed 45 times with an average reward of 0.4444.  
   - This is the button with the highest average reward and the most data, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Blue Button**:  
   - Pressed 14 times with an average reward of 0.4286.  
   - This is the second-best button in terms of average reward, but it has been pressed significantly fewer times than the orange button.

3. **Brown Button**:  
   - Pressed 12 times with an average reward of 0.4167.  
   - This button has a slightly lower average reward than blue but has been pressed fewer times than orange.

4. **Other Buttons (Green, Yellow, Black, White)**:  
   - Pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.3333.  
   - These buttons have lower average rewards and limited data, making them less attractive for exploitation.

5. **Red, Purple, Pink Buttons**:  
   - Pressed 1-2 times with an average reward of 0.0.  
   - These buttons have very low or zero rewards and limited data, making them poor choices unless we want to explore further.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: Focus on the orange button, as it has the highest average reward and the most data.  
- **Exploration**: Since we have only 12 time steps left, exploration should be minimal. However, we can allocate 1-2 presses to buttons like blue or brown to confirm their potential.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 10 time steps, we need to consider both the average rewards of the buttons and the uncertainty around those estimates. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the top-performing buttons based on average reward**:  
   - **Blue**: 0.42857 (pressed 14 times)  
   - **Orange**: 0.42553 (pressed 47 times)  
   - **Brown**: 0.41667 (pressed 12 times)  

2. **Evaluate uncertainty**:  
   - Buttons with fewer presses (e.g., **purple**, **pink**, **red**) have higher uncertainty because their average rewards are less reliable.  
   - Buttons like **blue**, **orange**, and **brown** have more reliable estimates due to higher press counts.  

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration**:  
   - **Exploitation**: Choose the button with the highest average reward (currently **blue**).  
   - **Exploration**: Test buttons with fewer presses to refine their reward estimates, but this is less critical with only 10 time steps left.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - **Blue** has the highest average reward (0.42857) and a reasonable number of presses (14), making it a reliable choice.  
   - **Orange** is close in performance but slightly lower (0.42553) and has been pressed much more frequently (47 times), so its potential for higher reward is less likely.  

Given the goal of maximizing total reward in the remaining 10 steps, **blue** is the best choice.

1. **Average Rewards Analysis**:
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward (0.4255) and has been pressed the most (47 times), making its estimate relatively reliable.
   - **Brown** has a slightly lower average reward (0.4167) but has been pressed 12 times, which is a decent sample size.
   - **Blue** has an average reward of 0.4 and has been pressed 15 times, making it a strong contender as well.
   - The other buttons (green, yellow, black, white) have lower average rewards and have been pressed only 3 times each, so their estimates are less reliable.
   - **Red**, **purple**, and **pink** have average rewards of 0.0 and have been pressed very few times, making them less attractive.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - Given that we only have 9 time steps left, the focus should be more on exploitation (choosing the button with the highest expected reward) rather than exploration (trying buttons with fewer presses to gather more data).
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward and a large number of presses, making it the safest and most rewarding choice.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Exploitation**: Choose buttons with the highest average rewards to maximize immediate gains.  
   - **Exploration**: Test buttons with fewer presses to gather more data and potentially discover better options.

2. **Current Best Performers**:  
   - **Orange button**: Average reward of 0.408 (pressed 49 times).  
   - **Brown button**: Average reward of 0.417 (pressed 12 times).  
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of 0.4 (pressed 15 times).  

3. **Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - **Green, Yellow, Black, White**: Average reward of 0.333 (pressed 3 times each).  
   - **Red, Pink, Purple**: Average reward of 0.0 (pressed 1-2 times).  

4. **Decision**:  
   - The **brown button** has the highest average reward (0.417) and has been pressed only 12 times, which is relatively fewer compared to the orange button. This suggests it might be a good candidate for further exploitation.  
   - However, the **red, pink, and purple buttons** have very few presses and low average rewards. Exploring these could reveal higher rewards, but the risk is higher.  

5. **Final Choice**:  
   Given the remaining 7 time steps, it’s better to focus on buttons with proven higher rewards rather than risking exploration. The **brown button** is the best choice due to its high average reward and fewer presses compared to the orange button.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 2 time steps, we should focus on the buttons with the highest average rewards so far, as they are the most likely to yield a higher reward in the next steps.

From the summary:
- **Orange button** has the highest average reward of 0.4117647058823529, based on 51 presses.
- **Blue button** and **Brown button** both have an average reward of 0.4, but they have been pressed 15 times each, which is significantly fewer than the orange button.

Given that the orange button has both a high average reward and a large number of presses, it is the most reliable choice for maximizing the expected reward in the next steps.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to choose the button that has the highest expected reward based on the information we have so far. Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Review the average rewards**:
   - **Blue**: 0.4 (pressed 15 times)
   - **Green**: 0.3333 (pressed 3 times)
   - **Red**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)
   - **Yellow**: 0.3333 (pressed 3 times)
   - **Purple**: 0.0 (pressed 1 time)
   - **Orange**: 0.4231 (pressed 52 times)
   - **Brown**: 0.4 (pressed 15 times)
   - **Pink**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)
   - **Black**: 0.3333 (pressed 3 times)
   - **White**: 0.3333 (pressed 3 times)

2. **Identify the highest average reward**:
   - The **orange** button has the highest average reward of 0.4231.

3. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**:
   - Since this is the 100th and final time step, the focus should be on **exploitation** to maximize the immediate reward rather than exploring buttons with fewer presses.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The **orange** button has consistently provided the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, indicating a reliable choice.
