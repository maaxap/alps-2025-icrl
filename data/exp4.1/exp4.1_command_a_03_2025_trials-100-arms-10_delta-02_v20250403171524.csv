A common strategy in such scenarios is to use a **bandit algorithm** like **Epsilon-Greedy**, **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**, or **Thompson Sampling**. However, since we have no data yet, the simplest approach is to start by exploring each button equally.

Given that all buttons have been pressed 0 times, we can arbitrarily choose any button to start. Let's choose the **blue** button as our first choice to begin the exploration process.

- **Yellow button** has a moderate average reward (0.3333) and has been pressed three times, giving us more confidence in its reward distribution.
- **Blue, green, red, purple** buttons have been pressed once each with an average reward of 0.0, but this doesn't necessarily mean they are bad choices; they simply haven't shown a reward yet.
- **Brown, pink, black, white** buttons have not been pressed at all, so their rewards are completely unknown.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **brown, pink, black, and white** have not been pressed at all. We should explore these to understand their reward distributions, as they could potentially yield higher rewards than the orange button.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only 10 time steps in (out of 100), it’s still early in the game. We should prioritize exploration to gather more data, especially for buttons that haven’t been tried yet.

Given this, the best choice is to explore one of the untried buttons. Let’s start with **brown**, as it’s the first untried button in the list.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **orange** and **brown** buttons have the highest average rewards so far (both at 1.0). However, they have only been pressed 3 and 1 times, respectively. The **orange** button has been pressed more times and still maintains a high average, making it a strong candidate.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **pink**, **black**, and **white** have not been pressed at all, so their rewards are completely unknown. Exploring these could potentially reveal higher rewards, but it’s risky since we have no data.

3. **Balancing Act**: Given that we’re early in the 100 time steps (only 11 steps completed), it’s still worth exploring a bit more. However, the **orange** button has shown consistent high rewards, making it a safer and more rewarding choice at this stage.

**Decision**: Since the **orange** button has the highest average reward and has been tested enough to show consistency, it’s the best choice for now.

   - **blue**, **green**, **red**, **purple** (each pressed 1 time with average reward 0.0)

3. **Decision**: Given that we have only 19 presses so far, it’s still early in the process. We should prioritize exploitation to maximize immediate rewards while also exploring buttons with fewer presses to gather more data.

   - **brown** has the highest average reward (0.75) and has been pressed only 4 times, so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **black** and **white** have not been pressed at all, so they are prime candidates for exploration.

Since **brown** has the highest average reward and has been pressed relatively few times, it’s a good choice for exploitation. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing **black** or **white** to gather data.

Given the current data, **brown** is the most promising button for immediate reward maximization.

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **orange** (average reward: 0.6666, pressed 6 times)
   - **brown** (average reward: 0.6, pressed 5 times)
   - **pink** (average reward: 0.5, pressed 2 times)

   - **black** (pressed 0 times)
   - **white** (pressed 0 times)
   - **blue**, **green**, **red**, **purple** (pressed 1 time each)

3. **Strategy**: Since we have only 20 out of 100 time steps completed, we should still prioritize exploration to gather more data about the buttons with fewer presses. However, we should also continue exploiting the buttons that have shown promising rewards.

4. **Decision**: Given that **orange** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation. However, **pink** has a good average reward but has been pressed only twice, so it’s worth exploring further. **Black** and **white** have not been pressed at all, so they are also good candidates for exploration.

5. **Final Choice**: To balance exploitation and exploration, let’s choose **pink** to gather more data about its potential reward, as it has shown a good average reward but hasn’t been pressed much.

   - **Blue**, **Green**, **Red**, **Purple**: 1 press each, average reward 0.0

3. **Decision**:
   - **Orange** and **Pink** have the highest average rewards, but **Orange** has been pressed more times, so its reward estimate is more reliable.
   - **Black** and **White** are completely unexplored and could have higher rewards, but pressing them is riskier since we have no data.
   - **Brown** is also a strong contender with a high average reward and more presses than **Pink**, making its estimate more reliable.

Given the current data, **Orange** is the most reliable choice for exploitation, but exploring **Black** or **White** could yield higher rewards if they turn out to be better.

   - Since we’re only 27 time steps in, there’s still room for exploration. However, exploiting the best-known button (**orange**) is a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.  
   - **Black** is an interesting candidate for exploration since it has a high reward (0.5) but very few presses (2), so its true potential is uncertain.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high reward of **orange** and its relatively higher number of presses, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should also consider exploring **black** due to its high reward with limited data.  

Since **orange** has the highest proven reward and we’re still early in the process, we’ll exploit it for now while keeping an eye on **black** for future exploration.

### Analysis of Past Choices and Rewards:
1. **Orange, Brown, Pink, and Black buttons** have the highest average rewards (0.5), but they have been pressed a varying number of times.  
   - Orange: 8 presses  
   - Brown: 6 presses  
   - Pink: 4 presses  
   - Black: 2 presses  

2. **Yellow button** has a lower average reward (0.3333) but has been pressed only 3 times, so it might still have potential.  

3. **Blue, Green, Red, Purple, and White buttons** have been pressed only once each and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons are underexplored and could have higher rewards.  

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: Focus on buttons with high average rewards (Orange, Brown, Pink, Black).  
- **Exploration**: Test underexplored buttons (Blue, Green, Red, Purple, White) to gather more data.  

Given that we have only 28 presses so far, there is still a lot of room for exploration. However, since Orange, Brown, Pink, and Black have consistently shown high rewards, it makes sense to continue exploiting them while also exploring underexplored buttons.  

### Decision:
Since **Black** has the highest average reward (0.5) but has been pressed only twice, it is a good candidate for exploitation. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing one of the underexplored buttons.  

Let's press **Black** this time to further confirm its high reward potential.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Black button**: Average reward of 0.6666 (pressed 3 times)
   - **Orange button**: Average reward of 0.5 (pressed 8 times)
   - **Brown button**: Average reward of 0.5 (pressed 6 times)
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of 0.5 (pressed 4 times)

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **blue, green, red, purple, and white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. This could be due to bad luck, so they might be worth exploring further.

3. **Decision**: 
   - The **black button** has the highest average reward (0.6666) but has been pressed only 3 times, so its true mean might not be fully understood yet.
   - The **orange, brown, and pink buttons** have consistent rewards but have been pressed more frequently.
   - The **yellow button** has a moderate reward (0.3333) and has been pressed 3 times, so it’s less promising than black.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the high average reward and limited exploration, the **black button** is the best choice for this step to confirm its potential.

For this step, let’s **exploit the black button** since it has the highest average reward so far.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify High-Reward Buttons**:  
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward (0.4444) with 9 presses.  
   - **Brown** and **Black** are close behind with an average reward of 0.4286, each pressed 7 times.  
   - **Pink** has an average reward of 0.4 with 5 presses.  

2. **Consider Exploration**:  
   Buttons like **blue**, **green**, **red**, **purple**, and **white** have only been pressed once and have an average reward of 0.0. While their average reward is low, it’s based on very little data, so they could still be promising. However, given the limited time steps remaining (64 out of 100), it’s riskier to explore these buttons extensively.

3. **Balance Exploitation and Exploration**:  
   Since **orange** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a reasonable number of times, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation. However, **brown** and **black** are also good options and have been pressed fewer times than **orange**, so they could still have higher potential.

4. **Decision**:  
   Given the data, **orange** is the safest choice for exploitation, but **brown** and **black** are also strong contenders. To balance exploration and exploitation, we’ll choose **orange** for now, as it has the highest proven reward.

   - **Brown** and **Black** buttons have the highest average rewards so far (0.42857).  
   - **Orange** and **Pink** buttons also have decent rewards (0.4).

   - **Yellow** has been pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.3333, which is lower than the top buttons but still worth considering for exploration.  

3. **Balance Exploration and Exploitation**:  
   - Since we’re only 37 time steps in (out of 100), there’s still room for exploration. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise.  
   - **Brown** and **Black** are the top candidates for exploitation, but we should also explore buttons with fewer presses to gather more data.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high average rewards of **Brown** and **Black**, and the need to confirm their performance, we’ll choose one of them for exploitation.  
   - **Brown** has a slightly higher average reward (0.42857 vs 0.42857 for Black), so we’ll press **Brown** next.

   - Since we’re only 43 time steps in (out of 100), there’s still room for exploration. However, we should prioritize buttons with high rewards to maximize immediate gains.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - **Pink** has the highest average reward and has been pressed only 9 times, so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, buttons like **blue**, **red**, **green**, **purple**, and **white** are still highly uncertain and could potentially yield higher rewards.  

Given the balance between exploration and exploitation, and the fact that **pink** has shown the highest reward so far, it’s a good choice to maximize immediate rewards while still leaving room for exploration later.

However, buttons like **blue**, **red**, **green**, **purple**, and **white** need more exploration. Let’s explore one of these under-tested buttons to gather more information.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Pink**: 0.4117647058823529 (pressed 17 times)
   - **Blue**: 0.5 (pressed 2 times)
   - **Orange**: 0.4 (pressed 10 times)

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times and could potentially have higher rewards:
   - **Green, Red, Purple, White**: Each pressed only 1 time with an average reward of 0.0.
   - **Blue**: Pressed only 2 times with a high average reward of 0.5, but we need more data to confirm its true potential.

3. **Balancing Act**: Given that we have only 48 time steps left (100 - 52 = 48), we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise but need more exploration to confirm their value. **Blue** stands out as a strong candidate because it has a high average reward but has been pressed very few times.

4. **Decision**: Let’s press the **blue** button next to gather more data and potentially exploit its high reward if it continues to perform well.

1. **Identify the best-performing buttons so far:**
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of 0.4117647058823529 over 17 presses.

   - **Yellow button**: Average reward of 0.3333333333333333 over 3 presses.

2. **Consider exploration for under-explored buttons:**
   - **Red, Green, Purple, White buttons** have only been pressed once and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons could potentially have higher rewards but need more exploration.

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration:**
   - The **pink button** has the highest average reward so far, but it has been pressed 17 times, which is more than other buttons.
   - The **orange button** has a high average reward (0.4) and has been pressed 10 times, which is fewer than the pink button.
   - The **red, green, purple, and white buttons** are under-explored and could potentially yield higher rewards.

4. **Decision:**
   - Given that we have 47 time steps left, it’s worth exploring the under-explored buttons to gather more information. However, since the **pink button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed more than others, it’s still a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - To balance, let’s explore one of the under-explored buttons with the highest potential upside.

   - The **orange button** also has a high average reward (0.4) but fewer presses (10), so it’s worth considering for further exploration.
   - Buttons like **green, red, purple, and white** have very few presses (1 each) and no rewards, so they are candidates for exploration.

3. **Decision:**
   - Since the **pink button** has the highest average reward and a decent number of presses, it’s the best choice for exploitation at this stage.
   - However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should also consider exploring buttons with fewer presses, like **green, red, purple, or white**.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the best-performing buttons so far**:
   - **White button**: Average reward of 0.5 (highest), but only pressed 2 times.
   - **Orange button**: Average reward of 0.4545, pressed 11 times.
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of 0.3889, pressed 18 times.
   - **Brown and Black buttons**: Average reward of 0.375, pressed 8 times each.
   - **Blue and Yellow buttons**: Average reward of 0.3333, pressed 3 times each.
   - **Green, Red, and Purple buttons**: Average reward of 0.0, pressed 2 times each.

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:
   - **White button** has the highest average reward but very few samples. It's worth exploring further to confirm its potential.
   - **Orange button** has a good average reward and more samples, making it a safe exploitation choice.
   - **Green, Red, and Purple buttons** have low rewards but few samples, so they might be worth exploring.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given the high potential of the **white button** and its limited data, it's a good candidate for exploration to confirm its high reward.
   - However, since we're aiming to maximize total reward, we should also consider the **orange button** as a safer exploitation choice.

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, and the high potential reward of the **white button**, I'll choose it next.

   - Buttons like **Green**, **Red**, and **Purple** have been pressed only 2 times each and have an average reward of 0.0, but this could be due to chance, so they also need exploration.

   - **Pink** has a slightly lower average reward but has been pressed more times, making its reward estimate more reliable.  
   - **Blue** and **Yellow** are worth exploring further, but their average rewards are lower than **Orange** and **Pink**.  
   - **Green**, **Red**, and **Purple** have low rewards so far but need more exploration.  

Given the current data, **Orange** is the best choice for exploitation, as it has the highest average reward and still has room for further exploration to confirm its potential.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify High-Reward Buttons**:  
   - **Pink** has the highest average reward (0.3888888888888889) with 18 presses.  
   - **Orange** is close behind with an average reward of 0.38461538461538464 and 13 presses.  
   - **Blue** and **Yellow** have the same average reward (0.3333333333333333) but fewer presses (3 each).  

2. **Consider Exploration**:  
   - Buttons like **Green**, **Red**, and **Purple** have been pressed only 2 times each and have an average reward of 0.0. These could be worth exploring, but their low reward so far makes them less attractive.  
   - **Brown**, **Black**, and **White** have been pressed 8 times each with an average reward of 0.375. They are decent but not the best.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Pink** has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of presses, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Orange** is also a good option but slightly lower than **Pink**.  
   - **Blue** and **Yellow** could be explored further, but their average reward is lower than **Pink** and **Orange**.  

Given the goal of maximizing total reward, **Pink** is the best choice at this stage.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Orange**: 0.3846 (pressed 13 times)
   - **Brown**: 0.375 (pressed 8 times)
   - **Black**: 0.375 (pressed 8 times)
   - **White**: 0.375 (pressed 8 times)
   - **Pink**: 0.3684 (pressed 19 times)

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times and could potentially have higher rewards:
   - **Blue**: 0.3333 (pressed 3 times)
   - **Yellow**: 0.3333 (pressed 3 times)
   - **Green**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)
   - **Red**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)
   - **Purple**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)

3. **Decision**: 
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward so far, but it has been pressed 13 times, which is more than the others in the top group.
   - **Brown**, **Black**, and **White** all have the same average reward (0.375) and have been pressed 8 times each, which is fewer than **Orange**.
   - **Blue** and **Yellow** have decent rewards but have been pressed only 3 times, so they could be worth exploring further.
   - **Green**, **Red**, and **Purple** have 0 average rewards but have been pressed only 2 times, so they are worth exploring to see if they have higher potential.

Given that we have 32 time steps left, it’s still worth exploring buttons that haven’t been pressed much to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially higher rewards. However, since **Orange** has the highest average reward and has been pressed more than the others in the top group, it’s a safer choice for exploitation.

From the summary:

- **Orange, Pink, Brown, Black, and White** have the highest average rewards, with Orange slightly lower than the others but still competitive.
- **Blue and Yellow** have shown some potential with average rewards of 0.3333, but they have been pressed fewer times compared to the others.
- **Green, Red, and Purple** have not yielded any rewards yet, but they have been pressed very few times, so they might still be worth exploring.

Given that we have only 31 time steps left (100 - 69 = 31), it's crucial to focus more on exploitation rather than exploration, especially since the buttons with the highest average rewards have been pressed a decent number of times.

Among the buttons with the highest average rewards, **Brown, Black, and White** are tied with the highest average reward of 0.375, and they have been pressed equally (8 times each). **Pink** is very close with an average reward of 0.3684 and has been pressed more times (19), which might indicate a slightly more consistent reward, but its higher number of presses suggests its potential might be slightly lower than the others.

Considering the need to maximize rewards and the fact that Brown, Black, and White have shown the highest average rewards with fewer presses compared to Pink, it makes sense to choose one of these buttons next.

   - **Pink button** has a slightly lower average reward but has been pressed 19 times, indicating more confidence in its reward distribution.
   - **Orange button** has a lower average reward compared to Black, White, and Pink but has been pressed 14 times, suggesting it might not be as promising.

3. **Buttons with very few presses:**
   - **Blue, Green, Red, Yellow, Purple buttons** have been pressed very few times (2-3 times) and have low or zero average rewards. These buttons might still hold potential and should be explored further, but given the limited time steps remaining, focusing on buttons with higher observed rewards might be more beneficial.

4. **Decision:**
   - Given the high average rewards and the need for further confirmation, **Black** and **White** buttons are strong candidates. Since both have the same average reward and have been pressed the same number of times, we can choose either one.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining time steps, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons that have shown the highest average rewards so far and exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information about their potential rewards.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Highest Average Rewards:**
   - **Black button:** 0.5 (pressed 12 times)
   - **White button:** 0.375 (pressed 8 times)
   - **Pink button:** 0.3684 (pressed 19 times)
   - **Orange button:** 0.3571 (pressed 14 times)

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation:**
   - **Black button** has the highest average reward but has been pressed 12 times, which is a moderate number. It’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **White button** has a high average reward and has been pressed only 8 times, making it a good candidate for further exploration.
   - **Pink button** has a high average reward but has been pressed 19 times, which is the most among all buttons. It’s still a good candidate but less so than black or white.
   - **Orange button** has a decent average reward and has been pressed 14 times, making it a moderate candidate.

3. **Under-explored Buttons:**
   - **Blue button:** 0.3333 (pressed 3 times)
   - **Yellow button:** 0.3333 (pressed 3 times)
   - **Green, Red, Purple buttons:** 0.0 (pressed 2 times each)
   - These buttons have been pressed very few times and could potentially have higher rewards, but their current averages are low.

**Decision:**
Given the current data, the **black button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, making it a strong choice for exploitation. However, the **white button** also has a high average reward and has been pressed fewer times, making it a good candidate for further exploration.

To maximize the total reward, we should prioritize the button with the highest average reward that hasn’t been over-exploited. Therefore, the best choice is the **black button**.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Highest Average Reward**: The black button has the highest average reward of 0.46153846153846156, based on 13 presses. This suggests that pressing the black button again could yield a high reward.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the black button looks promising, we should also consider buttons that have been pressed fewer times but still show potential. For example, the white button has an average reward of 0.375 based on only 8 presses, which is fewer than the black button. Exploring the white button further could reveal if it has a higher true mean reward.

3. **Low-Reward Buttons**: Buttons like green, red, and purple have been pressed a few times but have shown no reward (average reward of 0.0). These buttons are less likely to be optimal choices unless further exploration reveals otherwise.

4. **Moderate Reward Buttons**: Buttons like orange, pink, brown, blue, and yellow have shown moderate rewards. Among these, the pink button has a slightly higher average reward (0.3684210526315789) based on 19 presses, making it a decent choice.

Given the information, the **black button** stands out as the best choice due to its high average reward and sufficient number of presses to suggest reliability. However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options, we should also consider exploring the **white button** further due to its high average reward and fewer presses.

**Decision**: Since the black button has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of presses, it’s the most promising choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Under-explored Buttons**:

3. **Decision**:

   - **Blue, green, red, yellow, and purple buttons** are worth exploring, but their low rewards so far make them less attractive unless we need to gather more data.  

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, the **black button** remains the best choice for now, as it has the highest proven reward. However, if we want to explore further, **white button** is a strong candidate.

   - **White button** has a slightly lower average reward than black but has been pressed only 8 times, indicating it could be underexplored and potentially has a higher true mean.
   - **Pink button** has a good average reward but has been pressed 19 times, so further exploration might not yield much new information.
   - **Orange button** has a slightly lower average reward than pink and has been pressed 14 times, so it’s less attractive compared to black and white.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given the high average reward and the need to maximize total reward, **black** is a strong candidate.
   - However, **white** has a slightly lower average reward but fewer presses, making it a good candidate for exploration to confirm its potential.

1. **Identify the buttons with the highest average rewards:**
   - **Black button:** 0.4444 (highest average reward, pressed 18 times)
   - **Pink button:** 0.3684 (second highest, pressed 19 times)
   - **Orange button:** 0.3571 (third highest, pressed 14 times)

2. **Consider exploration:**
   - Buttons like **green**, **red**, and **purple** have been pressed only 2 times each and have an average reward of 0.0. However, since their sample size is very small, it’s possible they could yield higher rewards if explored further.
   - Buttons like **blue**, **yellow**, **brown**, and **white** have been pressed 3-9 times and have moderate average rewards (0.3333). They could also be worth exploring further.

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration:**
   - Given that we have only 19 time steps left (100 - 81 = 19), we should prioritize **exploitation** of the buttons with the highest known rewards to maximize immediate gains.
   - However, we should also allocate a few trials to explore buttons with low sample sizes but potential for higher rewards.

4. **Decision:**
   - The **black button** has the highest average reward (0.4444) and has been pressed a moderate number of times (18). It’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - We could also consider exploring **green**, **red**, or **purple** buttons, but given the limited time, it’s riskier.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Highest Average Reward**: The black button has the highest average reward of 0.47368421052631576, based on 19 presses. This suggests that black is a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While black has the highest average reward, it has been pressed 19 times, which is a reasonable number but not exhaustive. However, other buttons like pink (average reward 0.3684210526315789, 19 presses) and orange (average reward 0.35714285714285715, 14 presses) also show promising results and could be worth further exploration.

3. **Under-Explored Buttons**: Buttons like green, red, and purple have been pressed only 2 times each and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons could potentially have higher rewards, but we lack sufficient data to make a confident decision. However, given the limited time steps remaining (18), exploring these buttons might not be the most efficient use of our time.

4. **Decision**: Given the high average reward and the number of times it has been pressed, the black button seems like the best choice for exploitation at this stage. It has a significantly higher average reward compared to the others and has been pressed enough times to give us confidence in its performance.

   - **Pink button:** Average reward of 0.3684 (pressed 19 times)
   - **Orange button:** Average reward of 0.3571 (pressed 14 times)

   - **Yellow button:** Average reward of 0.3333 (pressed 3 times)
   - **Brown button:** Average reward of 0.3333 (pressed 9 times)
   - **White button:** Average reward of 0.3333 (pressed 9 times)

3. **Evaluate the exploration-exploitation trade-off:**
   - **Black button** has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of presses, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Pink button** is close in average reward and has been pressed almost as many times as the black button, making it another strong candidate.
   - **Orange button** has a slightly lower average reward but has been pressed fewer times compared to black and pink, so it might still be worth exploring.

4. **Buttons with very low average rewards and few presses (green, red, purple) are less promising and should be explored only if there’s a significant uncertainty about their true rewards.**

Given the remaining 17 time steps, the best strategy is to focus on the buttons with the highest average rewards while occasionally exploring buttons with fewer presses but decent potential.

**Decision:**  
The **black button** has the highest average reward and a sufficient number of presses to be confident in its performance. It is the best choice for exploitation at this stage.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify the best-performing buttons so far:**
   - **Black button**: Highest average reward (0.42857) with 21 presses.
   - **Pink button**: Second-highest average reward (0.36842) with 19 presses.
   - **Orange button**: Third-highest average reward (0.35714) with 14 presses.

2. **Consider exploration:**
   - Buttons like **green**, **red**, and **purple** have been pressed only 2 times each and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons could potentially have higher rewards, but we need more data to confirm.
   - Buttons like **blue**, **yellow**, **brown**, and **white** have been pressed 3–9 times and have similar average rewards around 0.333. These buttons are moderately explored but could still yield better results.

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration:**
   - Since we have only 16 time steps left (100 - 84 = 16), we should prioritize **exploitation** of the best-performing buttons while still exploring a few under-explored buttons.

4. **Decision:**
   - The **black button** has the highest average reward and is a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - However, we should also explore one of the under-explored buttons (e.g., **green**, **red**, or **purple**) to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option.

Given the limited time steps remaining, I’ll prioritize exploitation of the **black button** while keeping in mind the need for some exploration in the next few steps.

   - Buttons like **green**, **red**, and **purple** have an average reward of 0.0 but have been pressed only 2 times each, so they could still be worth exploring.

2. **Decision**:  
   - Given the remaining 12 time steps, it’s more beneficial to focus on buttons with higher average rewards and reliable estimates rather than exploring buttons with low rewards and few presses.  
   - **Black button** stands out as the best choice due to its highest average reward and sufficient number of presses.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Black button** has the highest average reward (0.42857) and has been pressed 28 times, indicating a good understanding of its reward distribution.  
   - **Pink button** has the second-highest average reward (0.36842) and has been pressed 19 times.  
   - **Orange button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.35714) but has been pressed 14 times.  
   - Buttons like **blue**, **yellow**, **brown**, and **white** have similar average rewards (around 0.3333) but have been pressed fewer times (3-9 times), suggesting they might still have potential.  
   - Buttons like **green**, **red**, and **purple** have an average reward of 0.0 but have been pressed only 2 times each, so they could still yield higher rewards.

2. **Decision**:  
   - **Black button** is the most promising based on current data, but it’s important to explore other buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options.  
   - **Green**, **red**, and **purple** buttons have been pressed the least and have shown no reward yet, but they could still have higher means. Exploring one of these could be beneficial.  
   - However, since we only have 9 time steps left, focusing on buttons with proven higher rewards is more critical.

3. **Final Choice**:  
   Given the limited time and the need to maximize rewards, the **black button** is the best choice as it has the highest average reward and a sufficient number of trials to confirm its reliability.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Highest Average Reward**: The black button has the highest average reward (0.4516) among all buttons, based on 31 presses. This suggests it is a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the black button has the highest average reward, some buttons like blue, yellow, orange, brown, pink, and white have been pressed fewer times and could potentially have higher true means. However, given the limited time steps remaining (6), it’s risky to explore buttons with lower observed rewards.

3. **Risk Assessment**: Buttons like green, red, and purple have been pressed only 2 times each and have an average reward of 0.0. Exploring these buttons could yield higher rewards if their true means are high, but the risk of getting low rewards is also significant.

4. **Optimal Strategy**: Given the remaining time steps, the best strategy is to focus on the button with the highest observed reward to maximize the expected total reward. The black button is the clear choice based on its high average reward and sufficient number of presses to estimate its mean accurately.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the average rewards**:  
   - **Black button**: Highest average reward (0.4411764705882353) with 34 presses.  
   - **Pink button**: Second-highest average reward (0.3684210526315789) with 19 presses.  
   - **Orange button**: Third-highest average reward (0.35714285714285715) with 14 presses.  
   - Other buttons (blue, yellow, brown, white) have lower or similar average rewards with fewer presses.  

2. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**:  
   - With only 3 time steps left, exploration (trying under-pressed buttons) is less valuable than exploitation (choosing the best-known option).  
   - The black button has the highest average reward and a sufficient number of presses to be reliable.  

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The black button is the best choice to maximize the remaining rewards.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 2 time steps, we should focus on the buttons with the highest average rewards so far, as they are more likely to yield higher rewards in the future. Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Black Button**: Has the highest average reward of **0.4571** over **35** presses. This suggests it is the most reliable choice for a high reward.
2. **Pink Button**: Has an average reward of **0.3684** over **19** presses, which is also a strong contender.
3. **Orange Button**: Has an average reward of **0.3571** over **14** presses, slightly lower than pink but still a good option.
4. **Blue, Yellow, Brown, White Buttons**: All have an average reward of **0.3333**, but fewer presses compared to orange and pink.
5. **Green, Red, Purple Buttons**: Have an average reward of **0.0** over very few presses, indicating they are unlikely to yield rewards.

Given the limited time steps remaining (2), the best strategy is to choose the button with the highest average reward and the most data to support its reliability. Therefore, the **black button** is the optimal choice.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Black Button**:  
   - Average reward: **0.4444** (highest among all buttons)  
   - Pressed: **36 times** (sufficient data to trust the average)  
   - This is the most promising button based on both reward and sample size.

2. **Pink Button**:  
   - Average reward: **0.3684** (second highest)  
   - Pressed: **19 times** (decent sample size)  
   - A strong contender, but slightly lower than the black button.

3. **Orange Button**:  
   - Average reward: **0.3571** (third highest)  
   - Pressed: **14 times** (moderate sample size)  
   - Good, but not as high as black or pink.

4. **Other Buttons**:  
   - Blue, yellow, brown, and white have similar average rewards (~0.3333), but lower than black, pink, and orange.  
   - Green, red, and purple have **0.0** average rewards, making them poor choices.

**Conclusion**:  
The **black button** has the highest average reward and a large enough sample size to trust its performance. It is the best choice to maximize the total reward in the final time step.
