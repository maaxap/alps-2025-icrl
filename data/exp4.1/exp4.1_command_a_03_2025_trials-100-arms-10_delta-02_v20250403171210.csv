To balance exploitation (choosing the button with the highest known reward) and exploration (trying other buttons to gather more information), we should consider the following:

1. **Exploitation**: The yellow button has the highest average reward, so choosing it again could maximize immediate reward.
2. **Exploration**: The brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all, so they could potentially have higher rewards. However, since we have limited information about the other buttons that have been pressed once, it might be more efficient to explore those first.

Given that we have only 100 time steps and need to maximize total reward, it’s reasonable to prioritize exploitation while still exploring buttons that have been pressed only once.

This suggests that the yellow button might be the most promising choice so far. However, it's also important to explore other buttons to gather more information about their potential rewards, as they have not been pressed enough to determine their true value.

Since the **brown**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** buttons have not been pressed at all, they are the most uncertain options. Exploring these buttons could provide valuable information, but given the limited time (100 steps), it's also important to balance exploration with exploitation of the best-known option.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Yellow button** has the highest average reward (0.6) and has been pressed the most, making it a safe choice for exploitation.
2. **Brown**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** buttons are unexplored and could potentially yield higher rewards, but this is uncertain.
3. **Blue**, **green**, **red**, **purple**, and **orange** buttons have been pressed once with no reward, but they are still worth exploring further.

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, the **yellow button** remains the best choice for now, as it has the highest known reward. However, in the next few steps, it would be wise to start exploring the unexplored buttons to gather more data.

Since the goal is to maximize total reward over 100 time steps, it's important to balance **exploitation** (choosing the button with the highest known reward) and **exploration** (trying other buttons to gather more information). 

At this early stage (only 11 time steps), it's still valuable to explore the buttons that haven't been pressed much, especially since their true rewards are unknown. However, the **yellow button** has shown promising results so far, and continuing to press it could yield higher immediate rewards.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Yellow button** has the highest average reward (0.6667) and has been pressed the most, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
2. Other buttons (blue, green, red, purple, orange) have limited data, so their true rewards are uncertain.
3. Since we're only 11 time steps in, there's still value in exploring less-pressed buttons, but the **yellow button** remains the most promising based on current data.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 12 times with an average reward of 0.5833. This is the most frequently pressed button and has a decent average reward, indicating it might be a good choice for exploitation.
2. **Brown Button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 1.0. This is the highest reward observed so far, but it's based on only one trial, so it's uncertain if this is a consistently high-reward button.
3. **Other Buttons (Blue, Green, Red, Purple, Orange)**: Each pressed once with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not shown any reward yet, but they could potentially have higher rewards since they are unexplored.
4. **Pink, Black, White Buttons**: Not pressed yet. These are completely unexplored and could have high rewards.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The yellow button has a proven track record of providing rewards, so it's a safe choice for exploitation.
- **Exploration**: The brown button showed a high reward in its single trial, and the unexplored buttons (pink, black, white) could potentially yield even higher rewards.

### Decision:
Given that we are early in the 100 time steps (only 18 steps completed), it's important to continue exploring to gather more information about the buttons. The brown button, despite being pressed only once, showed the highest reward. Therefore, it's worth pressing again to confirm if it consistently provides high rewards.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Yellow Button**: Pressed 12 times with an average reward of 0.5833. This is the most frequently chosen button and has a decent average reward.
2. **Brown Button**: Pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.6667. This button has a higher average reward than the yellow button but has been pressed fewer times.
3. **Other Buttons (Blue, Green, Red, Purple, Orange)**: Each pressed once with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not shown any reward yet but could potentially have higher rewards.
4. **Pink, Black, White Buttons**: Not pressed yet. These buttons are completely unexplored.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The brown button has the highest average reward so far, so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
- **Exploration**: The pink, black, and white buttons have not been tried at all, so exploring one of them could reveal a higher reward.

### Decision:
Given that we have only 20 time steps completed out of 100, there is still ample time for exploration. However, the brown button has shown promising results with a higher average reward than the yellow button. To balance exploration and exploitation, we should prioritize the brown button for now, as it has the highest known reward.

1. **Yellow Button**:  
   - Pressed 18 times with an average reward of **0.5555555555555556**.  
   - This is the highest average reward among all buttons with sufficient data.  

2. **Brown Button**:  
   - Pressed 4 times with an average reward of **0.5**.  
   - While this is a good reward, it is slightly lower than the yellow button and has fewer samples, so its true mean could be lower.  

3. **Other Buttons**:  
   - All other buttons (blue, green, red, purple, orange, pink, black) have been pressed only once with an average reward of **0.0**.  
   - These buttons have very limited data, so their true means are highly uncertain.  

4. **White Button**:  
   - Has not been pressed yet, so its reward distribution is completely unknown.  

**Strategy**:  
- The **yellow button** has the highest average reward with the most data, making it the safest and most rewarding choice at this stage.  
- Exploring other buttons (especially the white button) could be beneficial later, but for now, exploiting the yellow button maximizes expected reward.

   - **Brown button**: Average reward of 0.5 (highest so far) from 4 presses.  
   - **Yellow button**: Average reward of 0.476 from 21 presses.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The brown button has a higher average reward but fewer presses, so its true mean is less certain.  
   - The yellow button has a slightly lower average reward but more presses, making its estimate more reliable.  

3. **Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **white** have not been pressed at all, so their potential is completely unknown.  
   - Other buttons (blue, red, green, purple, orange, pink, black) have been pressed only once, so their true means are also uncertain.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **blue, green, red, purple, orange, pink, black, and white** have only been pressed once, and their average rewards are all 0.0. This could mean they are either very bad or haven't been explored enough.

3. **Strategy**: Since we have 66 time steps left, we should prioritize buttons with high rewards but also explore buttons that haven't been pressed much to avoid missing out on potentially better options.

Given the current data:
- **Brown** is the best-performing button so far.
- **Yellow** is a safe but slightly lower-performing option.
- Unexplored buttons could have higher rewards but are risky.

   - The **yellow button** has been pressed 21 times, so its reward distribution is better understood but is lower than the brown button’s current average.  
   - The other buttons (pressed only once) are highly uncertain and could potentially yield higher rewards.

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the limited data, the **brown button** is the best choice for exploitation because it has the highest observed reward so far.  
   - However, exploring other buttons (e.g., blue, green, red, purple, orange, pink, black, white) could reveal higher rewards, but the risk is higher since their rewards are unknown.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **brown button** has the highest average reward so far (0.5555555555555556) based on 9 presses. The **yellow button** also has a decent average reward (0.47619047619047616) based on 21 presses. Both are strong candidates for exploitation.

2. **Exploration**: Most of the other buttons (blue, green, red, purple, orange, pink, black, white) have only been pressed once and have an average reward of 0.0. This doesn't mean they are bad; it just means we don't have enough information about them yet.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only 38 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room to explore. However, given the limited time, it’s also important to focus on buttons that have already shown promise.

4. **Decision**: The **brown button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed fewer times than the **yellow button**. This makes it a good candidate for further exploitation to confirm its high reward potential.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Observations**:  
   - **Brown button** has the highest average reward (0.6) but has only been pressed 10 times.  
   - **Yellow button** has a decent average reward (0.476) and has been pressed 21 times, so its reward distribution is better understood.  
   - All other buttons (blue, green, red, purple, orange, pink, black, white) have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, which is uninformative.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The **brown button** looks promising, but we need more data to confirm its high reward.  
   - The **yellow button** is a safer choice with a known decent reward, but it might not be the best in the long run.  
   - The other buttons are completely unexplored and could potentially have higher rewards.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 61 time steps left (100 - 39), we should prioritize **exploitation** of the best-known button while still exploring the unexplored buttons occasionally.  
   - The **brown button** has the highest reward so far, so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, we should also explore one of the unexplored buttons to gather more information.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high reward of the **brown button** and the need to confirm its performance, it’s a good choice for this step.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between **exploration** (trying buttons with uncertain rewards) and **exploitation** (choosing buttons that have already shown good rewards).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Observations**:  
   - The **brown button** has the highest average reward (0.5) over 16 presses.  
   - The **yellow button** has a lower average reward (0.4545) but has been pressed more frequently (22 times).  
   - All other buttons (blue, green, red, purple, orange, pink, black, white) have been pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0, which doesn't provide enough information to assess their potential.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The **brown button** seems promising due to its higher average reward, but it has been pressed fewer times compared to the yellow button.  
   - The **yellow button** has a lower average reward but has been explored more, so its reward distribution is better understood.  
   - The other buttons (pressed only once) are still highly uncertain and could potentially yield higher rewards.

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since the **brown button** has the highest average reward so far and has been pressed fewer times compared to the yellow button, it is a good candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, exploring the other buttons (e.g., blue, green, red, purple, orange, pink, black, white) could reveal higher rewards, as they are still largely unexplored.  
   - Given the limited information, the **brown button** remains the best choice for now, as it has the highest observed reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **brown button** has the highest average reward (0.5555555555555556) based on 18 presses. The **yellow button** also has a decent average reward (0.45454545454545453) based on 22 presses. These are the two most promising buttons so far.

2. **Exploration**: Most of the other buttons (blue, green, red, purple, orange, pink, black, white) have only been pressed once, and their average rewards are 0.0. This could be due to bad luck, or they might have low reward probabilities. We need to explore these buttons further to confirm their potential.

3. **Current Strategy**: Since we have only 52 time steps left (100 - 48 = 52), we should prioritize exploitation to maximize rewards while still allocating some presses to explore the unexplored buttons.

4. **Decision**: Given the high average reward of the **brown button** and the limited time left, it’s a good choice to press it again to maximize immediate rewards. However, we should also allocate some presses to explore the unexplored buttons.

- **Brown button**: Pressed 19 times with an average reward of 0.5789.

The **brown button** has a higher average reward than the **yellow button**, despite being pressed fewer times. This suggests that the brown button might be a better choice for exploitation.

However, most buttons (blue, green, red, purple, orange, pink, black, white) have only been pressed once with an average reward of 0.0. This indicates that we still need to explore these buttons to understand their potential rewards.

Given that we have 51 time steps remaining and most buttons are unexplored, it's a good strategy to explore one of the less-pressed buttons to gather more information.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **brown** (0.5416666666666666) and **yellow** (0.45454545454545453). These are the best candidates for exploitation since they have yielded good rewards in the past.

2. **Exploration**: Many buttons (blue, green, red, purple, orange, pink, black, white) have been pressed only once or twice, and their average rewards are 0.0. This could be due to bad luck, or they might actually have low rewards. We need to explore these buttons further to confirm their potential.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we have 45 time steps left, we should prioritize exploitation for now but still allocate some steps to exploration. The **brown** button has the highest average reward and has been pressed 24 times, which is a decent sample size. The **yellow** button is also a strong contender but has been pressed slightly less (22 times).

4. **Decision**: Given the current data, the **brown** button is the most promising choice for exploitation. However, we should also consider exploring one of the under-explored buttons occasionally. For this step, let's prioritize exploitation to maximize immediate rewards.

   - These buttons could potentially have higher rewards, but we don’t have enough data to confirm.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since we’re only 56 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room for exploration. However, the **brown button** has consistently shown the highest reward, making it a safe and rewarding choice.

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:

   - **Brown button**: 31 presses, average reward 0.4516.
   - **Pink button**: 3 presses, average reward 0.3333.

2. **Exploration**: Many buttons (blue, green, red, purple, orange, black, white) have only been pressed once and have an average reward of 0.0. This could be due to bad luck, or they might have low reward probabilities. We need to explore these buttons to confirm their potential.

3. **Current Strategy**: Since we’ve already pressed the yellow and brown buttons many times, and their rewards are close, it’s a good idea to explore the less-pressed buttons to see if any of them might yield higher rewards.

4. **Decision**: Let’s explore one of the under-pressed buttons. A good candidate is the **red button**, as it has only been pressed once and its true reward potential is still unknown.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Brown button** has the highest average reward (0.46875) and has been pressed 32 times, indicating it’s a reliable choice.  
   - **Yellow button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.43478) but has been pressed 23 times, making it another strong candidate.  
   - **Pink button** has a decent average reward (0.42857) but has only been pressed 7 times, suggesting it might still have untapped potential.  
   - All other buttons (blue, green, red, purple, orange, black, white) have been pressed only 1-2 times and have an average reward of 0.0, indicating they are unexplored and could have higher rewards.

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we have 30 time steps left, it’s worth exploring the buttons that have been pressed fewer times to see if they yield higher rewards. However, we should not completely abandon the buttons with proven performance.

3. **Choosing the Next Button**:  
   - **Brown** and **Yellow** are safe choices but may not yield significantly higher rewards than what we already know.  
   - **Pink** has potential but has been pressed enough to suggest it’s not drastically better than brown or yellow.  
   - The unexplored buttons (blue, green, red, purple, orange, black, white) are worth trying, especially since they have not been tested enough.

4. **Final Decision**:  
   Given the need to explore, let’s choose one of the unexplored buttons. **Red** has been pressed only 2 times, making it a good candidate for exploration.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Brown button**: 32 presses, average reward 0.46875
   - **Yellow button**: 23 presses, average reward 0.43478
   - **Pink button**: 7 presses, average reward 0.42857

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **blue, green, purple, orange, black, and white** have only been pressed once and have an average reward of 0.0. This could be due to bad luck, or they might have low reward probabilities. Since we have limited time steps left (29 out of 100), we should prioritize exploring these buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially high-reward options.

3. **Decision**: Given that we have only 29 time steps left, it’s risky to focus solely on exploitation. We should explore one of the under-pressed buttons to gather more information. Let’s choose one of them randomly or systematically. For this step, let’s explore the **blue button** since it has only been pressed once.

1. **Identify the buttons with the highest average rewards so far:**
   - **Brown button:** Average reward of 0.46875 (pressed 32 times).
   - **Yellow button:** Average reward of 0.43478260869565216 (pressed 23 times).
   - **Pink button:** Average reward of 0.4444444444444444 (pressed 9 times).

2. **Consider the buttons with fewer observations:**

   - **Red button:** Average reward of 0.3333333333333333 (pressed 3 times).
   - **Green, Purple, Orange, Black, White buttons:** All have been pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0.

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration:**
   - The **brown button** has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of observations, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - The **pink button** has a slightly lower average reward than brown but has been pressed fewer times, leaving room for potential improvement.
   - The **yellow button** is also a strong contender but has been pressed more times than pink.
   - The buttons with fewer observations (e.g., green, purple, orange, black, white) should be explored to ensure we're not missing out on potentially higher rewards.

4. **Decision:**
   - Given the high average reward and sufficient exploration, the **brown button** is the safest choice for exploitation.
   - However, to ensure we're not missing out on potentially higher rewards, we should also consider exploring buttons with fewer observations.

Given the remaining time steps and the need to maximize rewards, the **brown button** remains the best choice for now, as it has the highest observed reward and a good number of trials.

### Analysis of Past Choices and Rewards:
1. **Brown button**: Pressed 33 times with an average reward of 0.4545. This is the highest average reward among the frequently pressed buttons.
2. **Yellow button**: Pressed 23 times with an average reward of 0.4348. This is also a strong contender.

4. **Blue and Red buttons**: Pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.3333. These buttons have lower average rewards compared to brown, yellow, and pink.
5. **Green, Purple, Orange, Black, White buttons**: Pressed only 1 time each with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not shown any reward yet but could potentially have higher rewards.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: Focus on buttons with high average rewards (brown, yellow, pink).
- **Exploration**: Occasionally try buttons that have been pressed fewer times (e.g., green, purple, orange, black, white) to gather more information.

### Decision:
Given that we have only 24 time steps left (100 - 76 = 24), we should prioritize exploitation to maximize rewards. Among the high-performing buttons, **brown** has the highest average reward and has been pressed more times, making it a reliable choice.

   - **Pink button** has the highest average reward (0.5) but has only been pressed 10 times.  
   - **Brown button** has a high average reward (0.441) and has been pressed 34 times, indicating consistent performance.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Pink button** has the highest average reward (0.5454545454545454) but has only been pressed 11 times, so its true mean might be lower.  
   - **Brown button** has a high average reward (0.4411764705882353) and has been pressed 34 times, making its estimate more reliable.  
   - **Yellow button** has a decent average reward (0.43478260869565216) and has been pressed 23 times, but it’s slightly lower than brown.  
   - Buttons like **green, purple, orange, black, and white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, but they could have higher true means.  

2. **Prioritizing High-Reward Buttons**:  
   - **Pink button** has the highest observed reward, but its sample size is small, so it’s worth pressing again to confirm its performance.  
   - **Brown button** is a safer choice due to its high reward and larger sample size, but we should also explore under-sampled buttons.  

3. **Exploring Under-Sampled Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **green, purple, orange, black, and white** have very few observations and could potentially yield higher rewards. Exploring them could lead to better overall performance.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Given the remaining 21 time steps, we should prioritize the **pink button** for its high observed reward, even though it’s under-sampled, to confirm its potential. If it performs well, it could significantly boost the total reward.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Exploitation**: Focus on buttons with the highest average rewards so far.  
   - **Exploration**: Test buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information about their potential rewards.

2. **Current Best Performers**:  
   - **Pink button**: Highest average reward (0.5) but only pressed 12 times.  
   - **Brown button**: Second-highest average reward (0.441) and pressed 34 times, indicating more reliable data.  
   - **Yellow button**: Third-highest average reward (0.435) and pressed 23 times.  

3. **Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - **Green, purple, orange, black, white**: Each pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons could have higher rewards but need more exploration.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - **Pink button** is the most promising based on its high average reward, but it has been pressed relatively fewer times compared to brown and yellow.  
   - **Brown button** is a safer choice with a slightly lower average reward but more reliable data.  
   - **Exploring under-pressed buttons** (e.g., green, purple, orange, black, white) could reveal higher rewards, but the risk is higher.  

Given the remaining 20 time steps, it’s crucial to balance exploitation and exploration. Since pink has the highest average reward and has been pressed fewer times compared to brown and yellow, it’s a good candidate for exploitation while still allowing room for exploration of other buttons later.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Pink button** has the highest average reward (0.5) but has been pressed 18 times.  
   - **Brown button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.441) but has been pressed 34 times, indicating more consistent performance.  
   - **Yellow button** has a lower average reward (0.435) but has been pressed 23 times.  
   - Buttons like **green, purple, orange, black, and white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, but they could potentially have higher rewards if explored further.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Given that we have only 14 time steps left (100 - 86), it’s risky to explore buttons with no observed rewards (green, purple, orange, black, white) since we don’t have enough time to confirm their potential.  

3. **Focus on High-Reward Buttons**:  
   The **pink button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed fewer times compared to the brown button. It’s a good candidate for exploitation.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Since the **pink button** has the highest average reward and hasn’t been pressed as much as the brown button, it’s the best choice to maximize the total reward.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 6 time steps, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons with the highest observed rewards and exploring the buttons with fewer observations to potentially discover higher rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Exploitation**: Choose buttons with the highest observed average rewards.  
   - **Exploration**: Test buttons with fewer observations to gather more data and potentially find better options.

2. **Current Best Performers**:  
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of 0.44 (highest) with 25 observations.  
   - **Yellow button**: Average reward of 0.4348 with 23 observations.  
   - **Brown button**: Average reward of 0.4286 with 35 observations.  

3. **Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - **Green, purple, orange, black, white**: Each pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0.  
   - **Blue and red**: Pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.3333.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - **Pink** is the best-performing button so far, but it has been pressed 25 times, so its reward distribution is relatively well-understood.  
   - **Yellow** and **brown** are also strong contenders but have been pressed fewer times than **pink**.  
   - **Green, purple, orange, black, white** have very few observations and could potentially yield higher rewards.  

5. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we only have 6 time steps left, we should focus on **exploitation** with a slight bias toward **exploration** for the least-pressed buttons.  
   - **Pink** is the safest choice for exploitation, but exploring **green, purple, orange, black, or white** could yield higher rewards if their true means are higher than observed.  

6. **Final Choice**:  
   - Given the limited time, **pink** remains the best choice for maximizing immediate reward, as it has the highest observed average and a reasonable number of observations.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Yellow** has the highest average reward (0.43478) and has been pressed 23 times, indicating a reliable choice.  
   - **Brown** and **Pink** also have high average rewards (0.42857 and 0.42308, respectively) and have been pressed 35 and 26 times, respectively.  
   - Buttons like **green**, **purple**, **orange**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, but this could be due to insufficient exploration.  

2. **Remaining Time Steps**:  
   With only 5 time steps left, the focus should be more on exploitation rather than exploration, as there isn’t enough time to gather significant new information about the under-explored buttons.  

3. **Choosing the Best Button**:  
   - **Yellow** has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of trials, making it the safest and most rewarding choice.  
   - While **brown** and **pink** are close in performance, **yellow** has a slightly higher average reward.

   - **Yellow** and **Pink** also have high average rewards, but slightly lower than **Brown**.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - Buttons like **Green**, **Purple**, **Orange**, **Black**, and **White** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to chance, and they might have higher true means.
   - **Blue** and **Red** have been pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.3333, which is lower than **Brown**, **Yellow**, and **Pink**.

3. **Strategy for Remaining Steps**:
