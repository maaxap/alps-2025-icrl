The goal is to gather information about the rewards of each button to make better decisions in the future.

A common strategy in such scenarios is to use a **bandit algorithm** like **Epsilon-Greedy**, **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**, or **Thompson Sampling**. However, since we have no data yet, the simplest approach is to start by exploring each button equally.

Given that all buttons have been pressed 0 times, we can arbitrarily choose any button to start. Let's choose the **blue** button as our first choice to begin the exploration process.

Since our goal is to maximize the total reward over 100 time steps, we need to explore the other buttons to gather more information about their reward distributions.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Current Information:**  
   - The blue button has been pressed once with a reward of 1.0.  
   - All other buttons (green, red, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed yet.

   - **Exploration:** Trying other buttons to gather more information about their potential rewards.  

3. **Strategy:**  
   - Since we have only 100 time steps, we need to balance exploration and exploitation.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current Data**:  
   - **Blue** and **Green** buttons have been pressed once each, both yielding an average reward of **1.0**.  
   - **Red** button has been pressed once, yielding an average reward of **0.0**.  
   - All other buttons (**Yellow, Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink, Black, White**) have not been pressed yet.  

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue** and **Green** are the most promising so far, but we only have one data point for each.  
   - **Red** has shown no reward, but it’s only one data point, so it’s not conclusive.  
   - The unexplored buttons could have higher rewards, but we don’t know yet.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we’re early in the 100 time steps (only 3 steps completed), **exploration** is still important to gather more data.  
   - However, we should also **exploit** the buttons that have shown potential to maximize immediate rewards.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - **Blue** and **Green** are tied in performance, so choosing either is reasonable.  
   - To break the tie, we can choose one of them to further confirm their reward potential.  
   - Alternatively, we could explore an unpressed button to gather more information.  

Given the early stage and the need to balance exploration and exploitation, I’ll choose to **exploit** one of the promising buttons to maximize immediate reward while still keeping exploration in mind for future steps.

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:
   - **Green button** has the highest average reward (1.0) so far, but it has only been pressed once. It’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Blue button** has a decent average reward (0.5) and has been pressed twice, providing more reliable data.
   - **Red button** has a low average reward (0.0) and is less attractive.
   - The unexplored buttons (yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) could potentially have higher rewards, but we have no data on them yet.

3. **Strategy at Early Stages**:
   - Since we are only at the 5th time step out of 100, it’s still early to focus solely on exploitation. We should continue exploring to gather more data.
   - However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise or have not been explored yet.

### Analysis of Past Choices:
1. **Blue, Green, and Purple buttons** have been pressed 2 times each, with an average reward of **0.5**. These buttons seem promising so far.
2. **Red and Yellow buttons** have been pressed 1 time each, with an average reward of **0.0**. These buttons have not yielded any reward yet, but it's too early to discard them completely.
3. **Orange, Brown, Pink, Black, and White buttons** have not been pressed at all. Their reward probabilities are completely unknown.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: Focus on buttons with the highest average reward so far (Blue, Green, Purple).
- **Exploration**: Allocate some trials to unexplored buttons to gather more information.

### Decision:
Since Blue, Green, and Purple have the same average reward (0.5), we can choose any of them for exploitation. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing an unexplored button.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between **exploitation** (choosing buttons that have already shown high rewards) and **exploration** (trying buttons that haven't been pressed yet to gather more information).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **orange button** has the highest average reward so far (1.0), but it has only been pressed once. The **blue**, **green**, and **purple buttons** all have an average reward of 0.5, but they have been pressed more times, so their estimates are more reliable.

2. **Exploration**: The **brown**, **pink**, **black**, and **white buttons** have not been pressed yet. We need to explore these buttons to understand their potential rewards.

3. **Strategy**: Since we have only 91 time steps left after this choice, it’s crucial to explore the unexplored buttons early to gather information. However, we should also exploit the best-known option occasionally to maximize rewards.

4. **Decision**: Given that the **orange button** has the highest reward so far but has only been pressed once, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing one of the unexplored buttons.

**Final Choice**: Let’s press the **orange button** again to confirm its high reward potential, as it’s the most promising option based on current data.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Exploitation**:  
   - The buttons **blue**, **green**, **purple**, and **orange** have been pressed 2 times each and have an average reward of **0.5**. These are the most promising buttons so far.  
   - The buttons **red** and **yellow** have been pressed once each and have an average reward of **0.0**. These seem less promising but could still have higher probabilities (we only have one data point).  

2. **Exploration**:  
   - The buttons **brown**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** have **not been pressed yet**. Their reward probabilities are completely unknown, so they could potentially yield higher rewards.  

### Strategy:
Since we are early in the process (only 10 out of 100 time steps), it’s beneficial to **explore** the unpressed buttons to gather more information. However, we should also continue to **exploit** the buttons that have shown good results so far.  

Given that **brown**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** are unexplored, we should prioritize one of these to maximize our understanding of their reward distributions.  

### Choice:
Let’s choose **brown** as the next button to press, as it is one of the unexplored options.

### Analysis of Past Choices and Rewards:
1. **Brown button**: Pressed once with an average reward of 1.0. This is the highest observed reward so far, but it's based on only one trial, so there's uncertainty.
2. **Blue, Green, Purple, Orange buttons**: Each pressed twice with an average reward of 0.5. These buttons have shown consistent but moderate rewards.
3. **Red and Yellow buttons**: Pressed once each with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not yielded any reward so far.
4. **Pink, Black, White buttons**: Not pressed yet. Their rewards are completely unknown.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The brown button has the highest observed reward, so it's a strong candidate for exploitation.
- **Exploration**: The pink, black, and white buttons have not been tried yet, so exploring them could reveal higher rewards.

### Decision:
Given that we have only 100 time steps and need to maximize total reward, it's crucial to explore buttons with unknown rewards while also exploiting the best-known option. Since the brown button has the highest observed reward and has only been pressed once, it's a good candidate for further exploitation to confirm its potential.

However, to balance exploration, we should also consider trying one of the untested buttons (pink, black, or white) to see if they offer higher rewards.

### Final Choice:
Given the high reward from the brown button and the need to confirm its consistency, I will choose the brown button next.

4. **Balanced Approach**: Given that we’re only 18 time steps in, it’s still early to fully exploit the best-performing button. Exploring the white button, which hasn’t been pressed yet, is a good strategy to gather more information.

**Final Decision**: Let’s explore the white button to see if it has a higher reward potential.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **white button**: 1 press, average reward 1.0
   - **pink button**: 3 presses, average reward 0.6667

2. **Exploration**: Buttons with fewer presses and uncertain rewards include:
   - **red button**: 1 press, average reward 0.0
   - **yellow button**: 1 press, average reward 0.0
   - **black button**: 1 press, average reward 0.0

3. **Strategy**: Since we have only 19 presses so far, we should prioritize exploring buttons with very few presses to better understand their potential. However, we also want to exploit the best-known options to maximize immediate rewards.

4. **Decision**: The **white button** has the highest average reward (1.0) but has only been pressed once. It’s a strong candidate for exploitation, but we should also consider exploring buttons like **red**, **yellow**, or **black** to gather more data.

5. **Final Choice**: Given the high reward of the **white button** and the need to confirm its potential, we’ll choose it next.

1. **Average Rewards**: All buttons that have been pressed more than once (blue, green, purple, orange, brown, pink, white) have the same average reward of 0.5. The buttons pressed only once (red, yellow, black) have an average reward of 0.0, but this could be due to insufficient data.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Since we have 100 time steps and have only used 27, we still have a significant number of steps left. It's important to balance exploring buttons with low data (to better understand their potential) and exploiting buttons that have shown promising results so far.

3. **Buttons with Low Data**: The buttons red, yellow, and black have only been pressed once and have shown a reward of 0.0. However, this is a very small sample size, and it's possible that these buttons could yield higher rewards. Pressing these buttons a few more times could provide more insight.

4. **Buttons with More Data**: The buttons blue, green, purple, orange, brown, pink, and white have been pressed multiple times and all show an average reward of 0.5. Given the current information, any of these could be a good choice for exploitation.

Given the need to balance exploration and exploitation, and considering that the buttons with only one press (red, yellow, black) have the least data, it makes sense to explore one of these buttons next to gather more information.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Buttons with High Average Reward (0.5):**  
   - blue (2 presses)  
   - green (2 presses)  
   - purple (2 presses)  
   - orange (2 presses)  
   - brown (4 presses)  
   - pink (10 presses)  
   - white (2 presses)  

2. **Buttons with Low Average Reward (0.0):**  
   - red (2 presses)  
   - yellow (1 press)  
   - black (1 press)  

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation:** The buttons with the highest average reward (0.5) are good candidates, but we should also consider how many times they've been pressed. Pink has been pressed 10 times, which is significantly more than the others, so its average reward is more reliable. However, brown has been pressed 4 times, and its average reward is also 0.5, making it a strong candidate.  
- **Exploration:** Buttons like yellow, black, and red have been pressed fewer times and have shown low rewards so far. However, since we only have 100 time steps, we should prioritize buttons that have shown potential but haven't been fully explored.  

### Decision:
Given that pink has been pressed the most and has a consistent average reward of 0.5, it’s a safe choice. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider buttons like yellow, black, or red, which have been pressed fewer times and could potentially have higher rewards.  

Since yellow and black have only been pressed once, they are good candidates for exploration. However, red has been pressed twice with no reward, so it’s less promising.  

### Final Choice:
Let’s explore **yellow** to gather more information about its potential reward.

1. **Identify high-reward buttons**:  
   - The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **green (0.5)**, **purple (0.5)**, **orange (0.5)**, **brown (0.5)**, **pink (0.5)**, and **white (0.5)**.  
   - These buttons seem equally promising based on their average rewards.

2. **Consider exploration**:  
   - Some buttons have been pressed very few times (e.g., **black** once, **blue** three times, **red** and **yellow** twice).  
   - We should explore these buttons more to confirm their true reward potential.

3. **Prioritize under-explored buttons with potential**:  
   - **Blue** has been pressed only 3 times with an average reward of 0.3333, which is not bad but not the best. It’s worth exploring further.  
   - **Black** has been pressed only once with a reward of 0.0, but it’s too early to discard it completely.  

4. **Make a decision**:  
   - Since **blue** has a decent average reward and hasn’t been explored much, it’s a good candidate for further exploration.  
   - **Black** is also under-explored, but its single reward of 0.0 makes it less appealing compared to **blue**.

We should explore these buttons more to gather better information.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since the buttons with 0.5 average reward are already well-explored (especially **pink**, which has been pressed 10 times), it’s a good idea to explore the less-pressed buttons to see if they might yield higher rewards.

4. **Decision**: Among the under-explored buttons, **black** has only been pressed once, which is the least explored. It’s worth trying **black** again to gather more data.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Since we have 100 time steps and have only used 32, we still have room for exploration.

3. **Prioritizing Buttons**: The red and yellow buttons have not yielded any rewards, so they are less promising. The pink button has been pressed the most (10 times) with a 0.5 average reward, which suggests it might be a safe choice but doesn't offer new information.

4. **Choosing the Next Button**: Given the information, pressing the blue button again seems like a good choice because it has a high average reward and has been pressed relatively fewer times compared to pink, allowing us to gather more data on its potential.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.625) and has been pressed 8 times. This suggests it might be the best option so far.  
2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red**, **yellow**, **green**, **purple**, **orange**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed only 2 times each, and their average rewards are either 0.0 or 0.5. These buttons could potentially have higher rewards, but we need more data to confirm.  
3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only 36 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room to explore. However, the **blue button** is a strong candidate for exploitation because it has consistently provided good rewards.  

Given the current data, the **blue button** is the best choice for now, as it maximizes the expected reward based on past observations.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.5556) among all buttons, and it has been pressed 9 times, which is a decent number of trials to estimate its mean. This makes it a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red**, **yellow**, **green**, **purple**, **orange**, **brown**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed only 2 times each, and their average rewards are either 0.0 (red, yellow) or 0.5 (others). These buttons could potentially have higher means, but we need more data to confirm.

3. **Trade-off**: Since we have 63 remaining time steps (100 - 37), we can afford to explore more. However, the **blue button** is already performing well, and pressing it again is likely to yield a good reward. Meanwhile, buttons like **red** and **yellow** have shown no reward so far, but they could be worth exploring to see if their means are higher than initially observed.

4. **Decision**: Given the current data, the **blue button** is the safest choice for exploitation, as it has the highest average reward. However, to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better buttons, we should also explore buttons with low sample counts and uncertain means.

**Final Choice**: Since the **blue button** has the highest average reward and is a reliable choice, we’ll press it again to maximize immediate reward while continuing to explore other buttons in future steps.

### Analysis:
1. **Exploitation**:  
   - The **blue** and **pink** buttons have been pressed the most (10 times each) and both have an average reward of **0.5**. These are strong candidates for exploitation since they have consistently provided rewards.  
   - Other buttons like **green**, **purple**, **orange**, **brown**, **black**, and **white** also have an average reward of **0.5**, but they have been pressed fewer times (2-4 times). This suggests they could be equally good, but we need more data to confirm.  

2. **Exploration**:  
   - The **red** and **yellow** buttons have been pressed 2 times each and have an average reward of **0.0**. These buttons have not yielded any rewards so far, but they have been explored very little. It’s worth exploring them further to see if their true reward probabilities are higher than what we’ve observed.  

### Strategy:  
Given that we have 62 remaining time steps, we should prioritize **exploitation** of buttons that have already shown good performance while also allocating some time steps to **exploration** of under-explored buttons.  

### Decision:  
Since **blue** and **pink** have the highest number of presses and consistent rewards, they are the safest choices for exploitation. However, to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better buttons, we should also explore **red** and **yellow** further.

3. **Low-Reward Buttons**: The **red and yellow buttons** have an average reward of 0.0, which is significantly lower than the blue button. There’s no incentive to explore these further unless we suspect their means might be higher (which is unlikely given the data).

4. **Decision**: Given the blue button’s strong performance and the lack of compelling evidence to explore other buttons with higher potential, the best choice is to **exploit the blue button** to maximize the expected reward.

### Analysis of Past Choices and Rewards:
1. **Blue button**: Pressed 12 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is the most frequently pressed button and has a consistent reward, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
2. **Green, Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink, Black, White buttons**: All have been pressed 2–10 times with an average reward of 0.5. These buttons show potential but need more exploration to confirm their true reward rates.
3. **Red and Yellow buttons**: Pressed 2 times each with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not yielded any rewards so far, but they have been explored very little, so they could still be worth investigating.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The blue button has the most data and a good average reward, so it’s a safe choice.
- **Exploration**: Buttons like green, purple, orange, brown, black, and white have shown promise but need more presses to confirm their reward rates. Red and yellow buttons, despite their poor performance so far, should also be explored further to ensure they are not overlooked.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between **exploitation** (choosing buttons that have already shown high rewards) and **exploration** (trying buttons with fewer presses to gather more information about their potential rewards).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Orange**: 0.6666 (pressed 3 times)
   - **Blue**: 0.4615 (pressed 13 times)
   - **Brown**: 0.5 (pressed 4 times)
   - **Pink**: 0.5 (pressed 10 times)
   - **Black**: 0.5 (pressed 2 times)
   - **White**: 0.5 (pressed 2 times)

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red**, **yellow**, **green**, and **purple** have been pressed fewer times (2-3 times) and have lower or moderate average rewards. They could potentially have higher true means, but we need more data to confirm.

3. **Decision**: 
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward but has only been pressed 3 times, so its true mean might be overestimated. However, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Blue** has a solid average reward and has been pressed more times, making it a safer choice.
   - **Red**, **yellow**, **green**, and **purple** need more exploration, but their low rewards so far make them less appealing.

4. **Trade-off**: Given that we’re only 44 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room for exploration. However, **orange** stands out as the most promising button based on current data.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red**, **yellow**, **green**, and **purple** have been pressed fewer times (2-3 times), and their average rewards are either low or moderate. However, they could still have higher true means that we haven’t discovered yet.  
3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only at 45 out of 100 time steps, there’s still room for exploration. However, the **orange button** stands out as a strong candidate for exploitation due to its high average reward and relatively low number of presses compared to the **blue button** (pressed 13 times with a lower average reward of 0.46).  

Given the current data, the **orange button** is the most promising choice to maximize immediate reward while still leaving room for further exploration later.

1. **Exploitation**: The **orange button** has the highest average reward (0.8) with 5 presses. This suggests it might be the best button so far, but we need to ensure this isn't just due to randomness.  
2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red**, **yellow**, **green**, and **purple** have been pressed fewer times (2-3 times) and have lower or moderate rewards. We should explore these more to confirm their true potential.  
3. **Current Best**: The **orange button** stands out as the most promising based on current data.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Orange button** has the highest average reward (0.7143) but has only been pressed 7 times. It’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Blue button** has a decent average reward (0.4615) and has been pressed 13 times, so it’s relatively well-explored but still a good option.  
   - **Brown, pink, black, and white buttons** all have an average reward of 0.5, but they have been pressed fewer times (2-4 times), so they might still have potential.  
   - **Green and purple buttons** have an average reward of 0.3333, which is lower, but they have only been pressed 3 times, so they could still be worth exploring.  
   - **Red and yellow buttons** have an average reward of 0.0, but they have only been pressed 2 times each, so they might still be worth exploring.

2. **Prioritizing High Rewards**:  
   The **orange button** stands out with the highest average reward and relatively few presses, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.

3. **Exploring Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   Buttons like **red** and **yellow** have very low average rewards but have been pressed only twice. Exploring them further could reveal higher rewards, but given the limited time steps remaining (52 out of 100), focusing on higher-reward buttons is more strategic.

4. **Decision**:  
   Given the high average reward of the **orange button** and its relatively low number of presses, it’s the best choice to maximize the total reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **orange button** has the highest average reward (0.6666) among all buttons, based on 12 presses. This suggests it might be the best choice for maximizing immediate reward.
2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red**, **yellow**, **green**, and **purple** have been pressed fewer times (2-3 times), and their average rewards are either low or moderate. However, since we have limited data on them, they could still have higher true means.
3. **Balancing Act**: Since we have only 47 time steps left (100 - 53), we should prioritize exploitation more than exploration, as we need to maximize rewards quickly. However, we should still explore buttons with low sample counts occasionally to avoid missing out on potentially better options.

Given the current data, the **orange button** is the most promising choice for exploitation. However, to ensure we don’t overlook other buttons, we should occasionally explore buttons with fewer presses. For this step, since the orange button has a clear lead and we’re halfway through the game, we’ll prioritize it.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Orange button** has the highest average reward (0.6923) and has been pressed 13 times, indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Blue button** has a decent average reward (0.4615) but has been pressed 13 times, so it’s less promising than orange.  
   - Other buttons like **brown**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** have moderate rewards but fewer trials, suggesting they could be worth exploring further.  

2. **Under-explored Buttons**:  
   - **Red** and **yellow** have been pressed only twice with zero rewards, but this could be due to chance. They are worth exploring to confirm their low reward potential.  
   - **Green** and **purple** have moderate rewards (0.3333) but have only been pressed 3 times each, so they could also benefit from more exploration.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high reward of the **orange button**, it’s a strong choice for exploitation.  
   - However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should also explore under-explored buttons with moderate rewards.  

Since **orange** has the highest reward and has been sufficiently explored, it’s the best choice for this step.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between **exploitation** (choosing buttons that have already shown high rewards) and **exploration** (trying buttons with fewer presses to gather more information about their potential rewards).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **orange button** has the highest average reward (0.75) and has been pressed 20 times. This suggests it is a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.
   
2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red**, **yellow**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed only 2 times each, and their average rewards are either 0 or 0.5. These buttons could potentially have higher rewards, but we need more data to confirm.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we have only 39 time steps left (100 - 61 = 39), we should prioritize exploitation to maximize rewards while still exploring a bit. However, given the high reward of the orange button, it’s the best choice for now.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Orange button** has the highest average reward (0.7619) and has been pressed 21 times, indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Blue button** has a decent average reward (0.4615) but has been pressed 13 times, so it’s a moderate choice.  
   - Other buttons like **brown**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** have average rewards of 0.5 but have been pressed fewer times, suggesting they might be worth exploring further.  
   - Buttons like **red** and **yellow** have an average reward of 0.0, making them less attractive unless we want to explore them further.  

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Given that we have only 38 time steps left (100 - 62 = 38), we should prioritize buttons with high rewards while still exploring a few under-sampled buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Orange button** is the clear leader in terms of average reward and has been pressed enough times to be reliable.  
   - **Brown**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** buttons have potential but need more exploration. However, since we’re closer to the end of the 100 time steps, prioritizing the orange button is safer.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Orange button** has the highest average reward (0.7917) and has been pressed 24 times, indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Blue button** has a decent average reward (0.4615) but has been pressed 13 times, so it’s a moderate candidate.

   - Buttons like **red** and **yellow** have 0.0 average rewards and have been pressed only twice, so they are risky but could be worth exploring.  

2. **Prioritizing High Rewards**:  
   Given the limited time steps remaining (35 out of 100), prioritizing buttons with proven high rewards is crucial. The **orange button** stands out as the best choice for exploitation.

3. **Exploration Consideration**:  
   While exploration is important, the remaining time steps are too few to justify extensive exploration of low-reward buttons like **red** and **yellow**. Buttons like **brown**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** could be explored, but their average rewards are not significantly higher than **orange**.

**Conclusion**:  
The **orange button** has the highest average reward and is the safest choice to maximize the total reward in the remaining time steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the average rewards**:  
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward (0.7931) with 29 presses.  
   - **Blue** has the next highest average reward (0.4615) with 13 presses.  
   - Other buttons (green, purple, brown, pink, black, white) have lower or equal average rewards with fewer presses.  
   - **Red** and **yellow** have an average reward of 0.0, making them the least promising.

2. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**:  
   - With only 30 time steps left, the focus should be on **exploitation** (choosing the button with the highest known reward) rather than **exploration** (testing under-pressed buttons).  
   - **Orange** has been pressed 29 times and consistently yields a high reward, making it the safest and most rewarding choice.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The **orange** button is the best choice to maximize the total reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **orange button** has the highest average reward (0.8) and has been pressed 30 times. This suggests it is a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red**, **yellow**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed only 2 times each, and their average rewards are either 0 or 0.5. These buttons could potentially have higher rewards, but we lack sufficient data to confirm.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we have only 29 time steps left (100 - 71 = 29), we should prioritize exploitation to maximize rewards. However, we should also explore buttons with limited data but promising potential, like **brown** (average reward 0.5, pressed 4 times) or **pink** (average reward 0.5, pressed 10 times).

4. **Decision**: Given the high average reward of the **orange button** and the limited time left, it is the safest and most rewarding choice at this stage.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Orange button** has the highest average reward (0.80645) and has been pressed 31 times, indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Blue button** has a moderate average reward (0.4615) and has been pressed 13 times, but it’s not as promising as the orange button.  
   - Other buttons like **brown**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** have average rewards of 0.5, but they have been pressed fewer times, so they might still have potential.  

2. **Exploration of Under-Pressed Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **red**, **yellow**, **green**, and **purple** have been pressed very few times (2-3 times) and have low or moderate average rewards. They could be worth exploring to see if they have higher true means.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given that we have 28 time steps left, we should prioritize exploiting the **orange button** since it has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be reliable.  
   - However, we should also allocate a few trials to explore under-pressed buttons like **red** and **yellow** to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options.  

For this time step, the best choice is to **exploit the orange button** since it has the highest expected reward based on current data.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining time steps, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons that have shown high rewards so far and exploring other buttons that might have higher rewards but have been pressed fewer times.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Orange button** has the highest average reward (0.7567567567567568) and has been pressed 37 times, indicating it’s a reliable choice.  
   - **Blue button** has a decent average reward (0.46153846153846156) but has been pressed only 13 times, so it might still have potential.  
   - Other buttons like **brown**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** have moderate rewards but have been pressed fewer times, so they could be worth exploring.  

2. **Prioritizing High Rewards**:  
   Given that the **orange button** has consistently provided the highest rewards, it’s the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.  

3. **Exploration Consideration**:  
   Since we have 22 time steps left (100 - 78 = 22), we can afford to explore a bit, but the focus should remain on exploiting the best-performing button to maximize total reward.  

**Conclusion**:  
The **orange button** is the best choice for this time step, as it has the highest average reward and has been consistently reliable.

3. **Other Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like green, purple, brown, pink, black, and white have lower or similar average rewards compared to the orange button, and some have been pressed fewer times, making their estimates less reliable.  
   - Red and yellow buttons have an average reward of 0.0, making them poor choices.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **orange button** has the highest average reward (0.7111) and has been pressed 45 times, indicating a reliable estimate.  
   - Other buttons like **blue** (0.4615), **brown** (0.5), **pink** (0.5), **black** (0.5), and **white** (0.5) have lower average rewards but fewer presses, suggesting their estimates might not be as reliable.  
   - Buttons like **red** and **yellow** have an average reward of 0.0 but have only been pressed twice, so their true rewards could be higher.  

2. **Prioritizing High-Reward Buttons**:  
   - The **orange button** is the clear leader in terms of both average reward and reliability.  

3. **Exploring Under-Tested Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **red** and **yellow** have very low sample sizes and zero rewards, so exploring them could reveal higher rewards.  
   - However, with only 14 time steps left, the risk of wasting a press on a low-reward button is high.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the limited time and the high reward of the **orange button**, it’s best to continue exploiting it to maximize the total reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the average rewards**:  
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward (0.7037) with a significant number of trials (54), making it a reliable choice.  
   - **Blue** has a decent average reward (0.4615) but lower than orange.  
   - **Brown**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** have the same average reward (0.5), but fewer trials make them less reliable.  
   - **Green** and **purple** have lower average rewards (0.3333) compared to orange.  
   - **Red** and **yellow** have 0 average rewards, making them poor choices.  

2. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**:  
   With only 5 time steps left, exploitation (choosing the button with the highest known reward) is the best strategy.  

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The **orange** button has the highest average reward and sufficient data to support its reliability.
