Exploration involves trying out buttons that haven't been pressed yet to gather more information about their reward distributions. Exploitation involves pressing buttons that have already shown promising rewards to maximize immediate gains.

Given the current data:
- **Green button** has been pressed once and yielded an average reward of **1.0**, which is the highest so far.
- **Blue** and **Red buttons** have been pressed once each and yielded average rewards of **0.0**, which are not promising.
- All other buttons (**yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white**) have not been pressed yet, so their reward distributions are completely unknown.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Exploitation:** The green button has shown the highest reward so far, so pressing it again could yield a high reward.
2. **Exploration:** We have 7 buttons that haven't been pressed yet. Exploring them could reveal higher rewards than the green button.
3. **Strategy:** Since we have only 3 time steps completed out of 100, it's still early in the game. We should prioritize exploration to gather more information about the buttons' reward distributions.

- **Blue** and **Red** buttons have been pressed once each and both yielded a reward of 0.0.
- The remaining buttons (**Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink, Black, White**) have not been pressed yet, so we have no information about their rewards.

2. **Highest Rewards:** Green and Yellow have the highest observed rewards.
3. **Unexplored Buttons:** There are 6 buttons that haven't been pressed yet, and we need to start exploring them to understand their potential.

   - **Blue**, **Red**, **Purple**, **Orange**, and **Brown** buttons have an average reward of 0.0, but they have only been pressed once, so their true potential is still uncertain.  
   - **Pink**, **Black**, and **White** buttons have not been pressed yet, so their rewards are completely unknown.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - **Exploitation**: Choosing **Green** or **Yellow** is a safe bet since they have shown the highest rewards so far.  
   - **Exploration**: Trying **Pink**, **Black**, or **White** could reveal higher rewards, but it’s risky since we have no data on them.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we’re early in the 100 time steps (only 9 steps completed), it’s still beneficial to explore buttons with unknown rewards to gather more information.  
   - However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown some promise or have not been tried at all.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - **Green** and **Yellow** are good candidates for exploitation, but we should also explore **Pink**, **Black**, or **White** to maximize potential rewards later.  
   - Let’s choose **Pink** next, as it has not been tried yet and could potentially have a high reward.

   - **Pink button** has the highest average reward (1.0) but has only been pressed once.  
   - **Green** and **Yellow buttons** both have an average reward of 0.5, but they have been pressed twice, which gives us slightly more confidence in their performance.  
   - All other buttons (blue, red, purple, orange, brown) have an average reward of 0.0, but they have been pressed only once, so their true potential is still uncertain.  
   - **Black** and **White buttons** have not been pressed at all, so their rewards are completely unknown.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - **Exploitation**: The **Pink button** has the highest observed reward, so choosing it again could yield a high reward.  
   - **Exploration**: The **Black** and **White buttons** are completely unexplored, and one of them might have a higher reward than the Pink button.  

3. **Decision**:  
   Given that we are early in the process (only 10 out of 100 time steps), exploration is still valuable. However, the **Pink button** has shown the most promise so far, and we should exploit it to confirm its high reward potential.

- **Blue, Red, Purple, Orange, and Brown** buttons have been pressed 1 time each and have an average reward of **0.0**.

2. **Exploration:** The Black and White buttons have not been tried yet. Since we have 89 time steps left, it’s worth exploring these buttons to see if they yield higher rewards.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Identify the best-performing button so far:**  
   The **black button** has the highest average reward of **1.0**, but it has only been pressed once. This suggests it might be a good candidate for exploitation, but we need more data to confirm its true reward potential.

2. **Evaluate other promising buttons:**  
   The **green**, **yellow**, and **pink buttons** all have an average reward of **0.5**, but they have been pressed 2 times each. These buttons are also worth considering, as they have shown consistent positive rewards.

3. **Consider exploration:**  
   Buttons like **blue**, **red**, **purple**, **orange**, **brown**, and **white** have an average reward of **0.0**, but they have only been pressed once. These buttons could have higher rewards, but we need more data to confirm.

4. **Prioritize exploitation vs. exploration:**  
   Since we have limited data on the **black button** (only 1 press), it’s a good candidate for further exploration to confirm its high reward potential. If it’s not chosen, we risk missing out on a potentially high-reward button.

**Conclusion:**  
Given the high average reward of the **black button** and the limited data available, it’s the best choice to maximize potential rewards while gathering more information.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we should focus on exploring buttons that have shown promising rewards while also continuing to explore buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information about their potential rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performers**:  
   - **Pink button**: Pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.75. This is the highest average reward so far.  
   - **Black button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is also a strong candidate.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - We should exploit the buttons with the highest rewards (pink and black) to maximize immediate gains.  
   - However, buttons like **green** and **yellow** have shown decent rewards (0.3333) and have been pressed only 3 times each, so further exploration could reveal their true potential.  
   - Buttons like **blue, red, purple, orange, brown,** and **white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. These could still be valuable, so some exploration is warranted.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high average reward of the **pink button** and the limited number of presses, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, to balance exploration and exploitation, we should also consider pressing buttons with fewer trials but decent potential, like **green** or **yellow**.  

Given the current data, the **pink button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed only 4 times, so it’s a good choice to maximize immediate reward while still allowing for further exploration in later steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the best-performing buttons so far**:  
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of 0.6 over 5 presses.  
   - **Black button**: Average reward of 0.5 over 2 presses.  
   - **Green and Yellow buttons**: Average reward of 0.3333 over 3 presses each.  

2. **Evaluate uncertainty**:  
   - Buttons like **blue, red, purple, orange, brown, and white** have been pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons still have high uncertainty and could potentially yield higher rewards.  

3. **Prioritize exploitation vs. exploration**:  
   - Since we’re early in the 100 time steps (only 19 steps completed), there’s still value in exploring buttons with high uncertainty.  
   - However, the **pink button** has shown the highest average reward so far, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high average reward of the **pink button** and the need to maximize total reward, it’s a good choice to exploit its potential.

From the summary:
- **Pink button** has the highest average reward (0.6666) and has been pressed 12 times, which is a good number of trials to have some confidence in its performance.
- **Green, Yellow, and Black buttons** have the same average reward (0.3333) but have only been pressed 3 times each, so there is still uncertainty about their true reward potential.
- **Blue, Red, Purple, Orange, Brown, and White buttons** have all been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, but this could be due to chance, and they might still have higher rewards.

Given that the **pink button** has consistently shown the highest reward and has been tested enough times to have some confidence in its performance, it is a good candidate for exploitation. However, to ensure we are not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should also consider exploring buttons that have not been pressed much but could have higher rewards.

Since the **pink button** is already well-tested and has the highest reward, and the other buttons with moderate rewards (green, yellow, black) have been tested less, it makes sense to continue exploiting the **pink button** while also keeping an eye on the less-tested buttons for potential exploration in future steps.

   - Buttons like **blue**, **red**, **purple**, **orange**, **brown**, and **white** have been pressed only once with no reward, so they are still largely unexplored.

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Since **pink** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, it’s a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - However, to avoid missing out on potentially better buttons, we should also explore buttons that have been pressed fewer times but show some promise.

Given the goal is to maximize total reward, **pink** remains the safest and most rewarding choice based on current data. Exploration can be done later if needed.

### Analysis:
1. **Pink button**: Has the highest average reward (0.5789) and has been pressed 19 times. This suggests it is a strong candidate for exploitation.
2. **Blue, Green, Yellow, Black buttons**: Each has an average reward of 0.3333 and has been pressed 3 times. These buttons have moderate potential but need more exploration.
3. **Red, Purple, Orange, Brown, White buttons**: Each has an average reward of 0.0 and has been pressed only once. These buttons need further exploration to determine their true reward.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The pink button has the highest average reward and is a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.
- **Exploration**: Buttons like red, purple, orange, brown, and white have been pressed only once and could potentially have higher rewards than currently observed.

Given that we have 64 remaining time steps, it’s still early enough to explore buttons with low sample counts while continuing to exploit the pink button. However, since the pink button has the highest observed reward and a reasonable number of samples, it remains the best choice for now.

**Analysis of Current Data:**

1. **Pink Button:**  
   - Pressed 27 times with an average reward of 0.5555555555555556.  
   - This is the highest average reward among all buttons, indicating it is the most promising choice for exploitation.

2. **Blue, Green, Yellow, Black Buttons:**  
   - Each pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.3333333333333333.  
   - These buttons have shown moderate rewards but need more exploration to confirm their true potential.

3. **Red, Purple, Orange, Brown, White Buttons:**  
   - Each pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0.  
   - These buttons have not shown any reward yet, but they could still have higher means. They need exploration.

**Decision:**  
Given that we have 56 time steps remaining, we should prioritize exploitation of the pink button, as it has the highest average reward so far. However, we should also allocate some time steps to explore the buttons with fewer presses (especially those with 1 press) to ensure we don't miss out on potentially better options.

For this time step, since the pink button has the highest average reward and we have already explored the other buttons minimally, we will exploit the pink button.

1. **Exploitation**: The **pink button** has the highest average reward (0.5357) and has been pressed 28 times, indicating it's a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red, purple, orange, brown, and white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. This could mean they are either bad or simply haven't been explored enough.  
3. **Trade-off**: Since we have 55 time steps left, we can afford to explore a bit more while still exploiting the best-known option.  

Given the pink button's strong performance and the need to maximize total reward, it's still the best choice for now. However, in the next few steps, we should consider exploring the under-pressed buttons to ensure we're not missing a better option.

- **Exploration**: The buttons with only one press (Red, Purple, Orange, Brown, White) are still unknown and could potentially yield higher rewards. Exploring them is necessary to avoid missing out on better options.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between **exploitation** (choosing buttons that have already shown good rewards) and **exploration** (trying buttons that haven't been pressed much to gather more information about their potential rewards).

### Analysis of Past Choices and Rewards:
1. **Pink button**: Pressed 35 times with an average reward of 0.5714. This is the highest average reward so far, making it the best choice for exploitation.
2. **Blue, Green, Yellow, Black buttons**: Each pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.3333. These buttons have shown moderate rewards but need more exploration to confirm their potential.
3. **Red, Purple, Orange, Brown, White buttons**: Each pressed only 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not shown any reward yet but could still have higher means.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The pink button has the highest average reward and is a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.
- **Exploration**: Buttons like red, purple, orange, brown, and white have been pressed only once and could potentially have higher means. Exploring these could lead to better long-term rewards.

### Decision:
Given that we have only 48 time steps left (100 - 52 = 48), we should prioritize exploitation to maximize the total reward. However, we should also allocate some steps to explore the under-explored buttons.

For this step, since the **pink button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed significantly more than others, it remains the best choice for exploitation.

1. **Exploitation**: The **pink button** has the highest average reward (0.5555555555555556) based on 36 presses. This suggests it is the most promising button so far.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red, purple, orange, brown, and white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0.

Buttons like **blue, green, yellow, and black** have been pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.3333333333333333, which is lower than pink but still worth considering.

3. **Current Strategy**: Since we have only 47 time steps left (out of 100), we should prioritize exploitation to maximize rewards. The **pink button** has consistently shown the highest reward, so it’s the best choice for now.

4. **Future Exploration**: Later, if we have more time steps remaining, we can explore the less-pressed buttons to gather more data.

1. **Exploitation**: The **pink button** has the highest average reward (0.5405) and has been pressed 37 times, indicating a relatively stable estimate. It’s the best choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red, purple, orange, brown, and white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, since their sample size is very small, their true reward could be higher. Exploring these buttons could potentially uncover a better option.

3. **Balancing Act**: Given that we have 46 time steps remaining (100 - 54), we should prioritize exploitation to maximize rewards but also allocate some steps for exploration. Since the pink button has already been explored extensively and has a high reward, it remains a strong candidate.

4. **Decision**: The **pink button** is the most reliable choice based on current data, as it has the highest average reward and a reasonably large sample size. Exploring other buttons with low sample sizes is risky at this stage, as it could lead to lower overall rewards.

However, since the pink button has consistently shown the highest reward, it’s the safest choice to maximize immediate rewards. Exploring other buttons could potentially yield higher rewards, but it’s riskier given the limited time left.

### Analysis:
1. **Pink Button**:  
   - Pressed **46 times** with an **average reward of 0.587**.  
   - This is the highest average reward so far, making it the best choice for exploitation.

2. **Other Buttons**:  
   - **Blue, Green, Yellow, Black**: Pressed **3 times each** with an **average reward of 0.333**.  
   - **Red, Purple, Orange, Brown, White**: Pressed **1 time each** with an **average reward of 0.0**.  
   - These buttons have either low or zero rewards, but they are underexplored.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The pink button has consistently provided the highest reward, so it’s a safe choice to maximize immediate gains.  
- **Exploration**: Buttons like red, purple, orange, brown, and white have been pressed only once and have zero rewards. They could potentially have higher rewards, but the risk is high.  

Given that we have **37 time steps remaining**, we should prioritize exploitation to maximize rewards while still exploring a few underexplored buttons.  

### Decision:
For this step, the **pink button** is the best choice because it has the highest proven reward and will likely yield the best immediate result.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The **pink button** has the highest average reward (0.5882) and has been pressed 51 times. This suggests it’s a reliable choice for exploitation.

2. **Exploration Opportunities**: Several buttons (purple, orange, brown, white) have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to chance, and they might have higher true rewards. Exploring these buttons could reveal better options.

3. **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation**: Since we’re at time step 69 out of 100, we still have some time to explore. However, the pink button’s consistent performance makes it a strong candidate for exploitation.

4. **Decision**: Given the pink button’s high average reward and the remaining time steps, it’s a good choice to continue exploiting it while occasionally exploring other buttons. However, since the pink button has already been pressed 51 times, it’s worth exploring one of the under-explored buttons to ensure we’re not missing a better option.

**Final Choice**: Let’s explore the **purple button**, which has only been pressed once and has an average reward of 0.0. This could be a chance to discover a higher reward.

From the summary:

- **Pink button** has the highest average reward (0.6) and has been pressed the most (55 times), indicating it's a reliable choice for high rewards.
- **Red button** has a high average reward (0.5) but has only been pressed 4 times, suggesting it might be worth exploring further.
- **Orange, brown, and white buttons** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, but this could be due to chance, and they might actually have higher rewards.

Given that we have 23 time steps left, it's a good strategy to continue exploiting the **pink button** since it has consistently provided high rewards. However, we should also consider exploring the **red button** a bit more to confirm its potential.

Since the **pink button** has proven to be the most rewarding so far, and we have limited time left, the best choice to maximize the total reward is to continue pressing the **pink button**.

   - This is the highest average reward among all buttons, indicating it is the most promising choice for exploitation.

2. **Other Buttons**:

   - **Orange, Brown, White Buttons**: Pressed 1 time each with an average reward of **0.0**.  
   - These buttons have either lower average rewards or insufficient data to make a confident decision.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - With only 22 time steps remaining (100 - 78 = 22), the focus should be on exploiting the button with the highest known reward to maximize the total reward.

1. **Exploitation**: The **pink button** has the highest average reward (0.6207) and has been pressed the most (58 times), indicating a relatively stable estimate. It’s the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **orange**, **brown**, and **white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, their low sample size means their true reward means could be higher. Exploring these buttons could potentially uncover a better option, but with only 20 time steps left, the risk of wasting steps on low-reward buttons is high.

3. **Other Buttons**: Buttons like **blue**, **green**, **yellow**, **purple**, and **black** have moderate sample sizes (3 presses each) and similar average rewards (0.3333). They are less promising than **pink** but more reliable than the unexplored buttons.

**Decision**: Given the limited time steps remaining, the best strategy is to exploit the **pink button**, as it has the highest observed reward and a relatively stable estimate. Exploration of under-sampled buttons is too risky at this stage.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **pink button** has the highest average reward (0.619) and has been pressed the most (63 times), indicating it is likely the best option based on current data.

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons (orange, brown, white) have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to bad luck, and they might have higher true means. Exploring these buttons could reveal better options, but with only 15 time steps left, the risk of wasting a step on a low-reward button is high.

3. **Other Buttons**: Buttons like blue, green, yellow, purple, and black have been pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.333. These are less promising than pink but could still be worth exploring if pink's performance drops. The red button has a higher average reward (0.5) but has been pressed only 4 times, making it a moderate option.

4. **Decision**: Given the limited time steps remaining, the best strategy is to **exploit the pink button**, as it has consistently provided the highest rewards. Exploring other buttons is too risky at this stage.

### Analysis:
1. **Pink Button**:  
   - Pressed **64 times** with an average reward of **0.625**.  
   - This is the highest average reward among all buttons and has been pressed the most, indicating a reliable estimate.  

2. **Red Button**:  
   - Pressed **4 times** with an average reward of **0.5**.  
   - This is the second-highest average reward but with fewer presses, so the estimate might not be as reliable.  

3. **Other Buttons**:  
   - **Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple, Black** have been pressed **3 times each** with an average reward of **0.3333**.  
   - **Orange, Brown, White** have been pressed **1 time each** with an average reward of **0.0**, but this is based on very limited data.  

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The pink button has the highest average reward and a large number of presses, making it the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
- **Exploration**: The red button has a promising average reward but fewer presses, so exploring it further could be beneficial.  
- **Other Buttons**: Exploring buttons like orange, brown, or white could reveal higher rewards, but the risk is higher due to their low average rewards so far.  

### Decision:
Given the limited time steps remaining (14 out of 100), the focus should be on **exploitation** to maximize the total reward. The pink button is the most reliable choice based on the data.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the highest average reward**: The pink button has the highest average reward (0.6307692307692307) based on 65 presses, which is a relatively large sample size. This suggests that the pink button is likely the best choice.

2. **Consider uncertainty in less-pressed buttons**: Buttons like orange, brown, and white have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, with such a small sample size, their true reward means could be higher. Exploring these buttons could potentially reveal a better option, but given the limited time steps remaining (13), the risk of not gaining a reward might outweigh the potential benefit.

3. **Balance exploration and exploitation**: Since we have only 13 time steps left, it’s more critical to exploit the best-known option rather than explore uncertain ones. The pink button has a proven track record and is the safest bet to maximize rewards.

Given this analysis, the best choice is to press the pink button again.

### Analysis:
1. **Pink Button**:  
   - Pressed **66 times** with an average reward of **0.6363636363636364**.  
   - This is the highest average reward observed so far, making it the most promising choice for exploitation.

2. **Red Button**:  
   - Pressed **4 times** with an average reward of **0.5**.  
   - While this is a decent reward, it has been pressed fewer times compared to the pink button, so its true potential is less certain.

3. **Other Buttons**:  
   - **Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple, Black**: Pressed **3 times each** with an average reward of **0.3333333333333333**.  
   - These buttons have lower average rewards and have been explored minimally.  
   - **Orange, Brown, White**: Pressed **1 time each** with an average reward of **0.0**.  
   - These buttons have not shown any reward yet but could still have higher potential.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The pink button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, so it is the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
- **Exploration**: While the pink button is the best known option, there are still buttons (like orange, brown, and white) that have been pressed only once and could potentially yield higher rewards. However, given the limited time steps remaining (12), exploring these buttons carries a higher risk of missing out on higher rewards from the pink button.

### Decision:

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining time steps, we need to consider both the average rewards observed so far and the uncertainty associated with buttons that have been pressed fewer times. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the highest average reward**: The pink button has the highest average reward (0.647887323943662) based on 71 presses, which is a significant number of trials, making this estimate relatively reliable.

2. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**: While the pink button has the highest average reward, there are buttons like orange, brown, and white that have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, given that we only have 7 time steps left (100 - 93), the potential gain from exploring these buttons is limited, and the risk of not getting a reward is high.

3. **Focus on exploitation**: Given the limited time remaining, it is more strategic to exploit the button with the highest known average reward rather than exploring buttons with uncertain outcomes.

Therefore, the best choice is to press the pink button again to maximize the expected reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performer**: The **pink button** has the highest average reward (0.6388888888888888) based on 72 presses. This suggests it is the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: While the pink button is the best so far, buttons like **orange**, **brown**, and **white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. This could be due to bad luck, and their true means might be higher. Exploring these buttons could reveal a better option, but with only 6 time steps left, the risk of wasting presses on potentially low-reward buttons is high.

3. **Other Buttons**: Buttons like **blue**, **green**, **yellow**, **purple**, and **black** have been pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.3333333333333333. These are significantly lower than the pink button and do not warrant further exploration given the limited time.

4. **Red Button**: The **red button** has an average reward of 0.5 based on 4 presses, which is lower than the pink button but higher than the other explored buttons. However, it is not as reliable as the pink button given the limited data.

**Conclusion**: Given the high average reward of the pink button and the limited time remaining, the best strategy is to continue exploiting the pink button to maximize the total reward.

1. **Average Rewards**:  
   - The **pink button** has the highest average reward (0.6438) based on 73 presses.  
   - The **red button** has the next highest average reward (0.5) based on 4 presses.  
   - All other buttons have lower or zero average rewards.

2. **Uncertainty in Estimates**:  
   - Buttons like **orange**, **brown**, and **white** have been pressed only once, so their average rewards (0.0) are highly uncertain.  
   - Buttons like **blue**, **green**, **yellow**, **purple**, and **black** have been pressed 3 times each, but their average rewards (0.3333) are still lower than **pink** and **red**.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - Since we only have 5 time steps left, **exploitation** (choosing the button with the highest known reward) is more important than **exploration** (trying under-explored buttons).  
   - The **pink button** has the highest average reward and a relatively low uncertainty due to its high number of presses (73).

2. **Red Button**: It has a high average reward (0.5) but has only been pressed 4 times. There's more uncertainty here, but it could potentially yield a higher reward than the pink button if its true mean is higher.

3. **Other Buttons**: Buttons like orange, brown, and white have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, but this is based on very little data. They could have higher true means, but the risk is high.

4. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: With only 3 time steps left, the focus should be on exploitation rather than exploration, as we don't have enough time to gather more data and improve our estimates significantly.
