From the summary:
- **Green button** has been pressed once and yielded an average reward of **1.0**, which is the highest so far.
- **Blue** and **Red buttons** have been pressed once each and yielded average rewards of **0.0**, which are not promising.
- All other buttons (**yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white**) have not been pressed yet, so their rewards are unknown.

Given that we have only 3 data points and 100 time steps remaining, it's crucial to explore the untested buttons to gather more information. However, since the **green button** has already shown a high reward, it's also a good candidate for exploitation.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Exploitation:** The green button has the highest known reward, so pressing it again could yield another high reward.
2. **Exploration:** We need to test the untried buttons to discover potentially better options.

From the summary:
- **Green, Yellow, and Orange** buttons have the highest average reward (0.5) based on the limited data.
- **Pink, Black, and White** buttons have not been pressed yet, so their rewards are completely unknown.
- **Blue, Red, Purple, and Brown** buttons have been pressed once and yielded a reward of 0.0, but this is based on very limited data.

Given that we have only 100 time steps, it’s important to explore the untested buttons early to gather more information. However, since **Green, Yellow, and Orange** have shown promising results, we should also exploit them to maximize immediate rewards.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Exploitation:** Green, Yellow, and Orange have the highest average reward so far.
2. **Exploration:** Pink, Black, and White are untested and could potentially have higher rewards.
3. **Strategy:** Since we’re early in the process (only 10 steps out of 100), it’s a good time to explore untested buttons while also exploiting the best-known options.

**Decision:** Let’s explore one of the untested buttons to gather more information. Among Pink, Black, and White, we can choose any one. For simplicity, let’s choose **Pink**.

- **Green, Yellow, and Orange buttons** have the next highest average reward (0.5) and have been pressed twice each.
- **Blue, Red, Purple, and Brown buttons** have an average reward of 0.0 and have been pressed once each.

2. **Exploration:** The black and white buttons have not been pressed yet, so their rewards are completely unknown. Exploring them could reveal higher rewards.
3. **Balancing:** Since we have 89 time steps left, we can afford to explore a bit more while still exploiting the best-known option.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Pink button** has the highest average reward (1.0) from 2 presses, making it the most promising button to exploit.  
   - **Green, Yellow, and Orange buttons** have an average reward of 0.5, which is decent but not as high as pink.  
   - **Blue, Red, Purple, and Brown buttons** have an average reward of 0.0, indicating they might not be as rewarding.  
   - **Black and White buttons** have not been pressed yet, so their potential is unknown.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we have only used 12 out of 100 time steps, there is still ample opportunity to explore. However, given the limited data, it’s risky to explore buttons with no data (black and white) when we have a button (pink) that has shown a perfect reward so far.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Exploit the pink button** to maximize immediate reward, as it has the highest average reward.  
   - **Avoid exploring black and white** for now, as they have no data and could be risky choices.

   - **Pink button** has the highest average reward (1.0) over 3 presses, making it the most promising choice for exploitation.  
   - **Black** and **white** buttons have not been pressed at all, so they are the most unexplored. However, since we have limited time steps (100), we should prioritize buttons with higher observed rewards unless there’s a strong reason to explore.  

2. **Current Observations**:  
   - **Pink** is the clear leader with a perfect reward average.  
   - **Green**, **yellow**, and **orange** have decent averages (0.5) but fewer presses compared to **pink**.  
   - **Blue**, **red**, **purple**, and **brown** have low or zero rewards and are less promising.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high reward consistency of the **pink** button, it is the best choice for exploitation at this stage.

**Analysis of Current Data:**

1. **Pink Button:**  
   - Pressed 9 times with an average reward of 0.6666.  
   - This is the highest average reward so far, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Green, Yellow, Orange Buttons:**  
   - Each pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5.  
   - These buttons have shown potential but need more exploration to confirm their true reward.

3. **Blue, Red, Purple, Brown Buttons:**  
   - Each pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0.  
   - These buttons have not shown any reward yet but could still be worth exploring.

4. **Black and White Buttons:**  
   - Not pressed yet.  
   - These buttons are completely unexplored and could have high rewards.

**Strategy:**  
- **Exploitation:** The pink button has the highest average reward, so pressing it again is a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.  
- **Exploration:** The black and white buttons are completely unexplored, and exploring them could reveal higher rewards than the pink button.  

**Decision:**  
Given that we have only 19 presses out of 100, it’s still early in the game, and exploration is crucial. The black and white buttons are completely unexplored, and one of them could potentially yield a higher reward than the pink button.

1. **Exploitation**: The **pink** button has the highest average reward (0.6667) with 9 presses, and the **black** button has a perfect reward of 1.0 but has only been pressed once. Both are strong candidates for exploitation.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **white** have not been pressed at all, and others like **blue**, **red**, **purple**, and **brown** have been pressed only once with no reward. These could be worth exploring to see if they yield higher rewards.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re early in the process (20/100 time steps), exploration is still important. However, the **black** button’s perfect reward with only one press is highly promising and warrants further investigation before committing to **pink**.

**Decision**: Press the **black** button again to confirm its high reward potential.

1. **Exploitation**: The **pink button** has the highest average reward (0.5385) and has been pressed 13 times, which is more than any other button. This suggests it might be the best option so far.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red**, **purple**, and **brown** have only been pressed once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to bad luck, and they might actually have higher rewards. We should consider exploring these buttons to gather more data.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we have 72 time steps left (100 - 28 = 72), we can afford to explore a bit more. However, exploiting the **pink button** is still a strong option because it has consistently performed well.

4. **Decision**: Given the current data, the **pink button** is the safest and most rewarding choice. Exploring other buttons like **red**, **purple**, or **brown** could be risky, as they haven’t shown any positive rewards yet.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Since we have 100 time steps and have only used 29 so far, we still have room for exploration. However, given the limited data, buttons with zero average rewards (red, purple, brown) might not be the best choices unless we want to explore them further.

3. **Best Performing Button**: The pink button has not only the highest average reward but also the most data points (14 presses), making its average more reliable compared to buttons with fewer presses.

4. **Decision**: Given the information, the pink button seems to be the best choice as it has the highest average reward and a relatively large number of trials, making its average more trustworthy.

2. **Number of Trials**: The pink button has been pressed 15 times, which is significantly more than the other buttons. This gives us more confidence in its average reward estimate compared to buttons with fewer trials.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Since we have 70 time steps remaining, we should balance exploration (trying under-explored buttons) and exploitation (choosing the button with the highest known reward). However, given the limited information and the clear lead of the pink button, it's reasonable to exploit the pink button more to maximize rewards.

4. **Under-explored Buttons**: Buttons like red, purple, and brown have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, given their low average reward and the high reward of the pink button, exploring them further is less appealing at this stage.

Considering the above analysis, the best choice to maximize the total reward is to press the pink button again.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Buttons with High Average Reward (0.5):**  
   - blue (2 presses)  
   - green (2 presses)  
   - yellow (2 presses)  
   - orange (2 presses)  
   - pink (18 presses)

2. **Buttons with Low Average Reward (0.0):**  
   - red (2 presses)  
   - purple (1 press)  
   - brown (1 press)  

### Observations:
- **Pink** has been pressed the most (18 times) and has a consistent average reward of 0.5, making it a reliable choice for exploitation.  
- **Red, purple, and brown** have low average rewards but have been pressed very few times (1 or 2 times), so they could still have higher true means. These are good candidates for exploration.  
- The other buttons (blue, green, yellow, orange, black, white) have been pressed 2 times each and show a 0.5 average reward. They are moderately explored but could still be worth pressing to confirm their true means.  

### Strategy:
Since we have 66 time steps remaining, we should prioritize **exploration** of the less-pressed buttons (red, purple, brown) to gather more information about their potential rewards. If none of these buttons show promise after further exploration, we can revert to exploiting the buttons with known good rewards (like pink).

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between **exploitation** (choosing buttons that have already shown good rewards) and **exploration** (trying buttons that haven't been pressed much to gather more information about their potential rewards).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **blue, green, yellow, orange, pink, black, and white**, all with an average reward of **0.5**. However, **pink** has been pressed 18 times, which is significantly more than the others, so its reward estimate is more reliable.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **purple** and **brown** have been pressed only 2 times each and have an average reward of **0.0**. This could mean they are low-reward buttons, but since they haven't been pressed much, there's still uncertainty about their true reward potential.

3. **Strategy**: Since we have 63 time steps remaining, we should continue to explore buttons that haven't been pressed much to confirm their reward potential. However, we should also exploit the buttons that have shown good rewards so far.

Given the current data:
- **Pink** has the most reliable high reward but has been pressed a lot.
- **Purple** and **brown** have low rewards but need more exploration.
- **Blue, green, yellow, orange, black, and white** have good rewards but need more presses to confirm.

To balance exploration and exploitation, let's choose a button that has shown good potential but hasn't been pressed as much as **pink**.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.6666) among the buttons that have been pressed more than once. However, it has only been pressed 3 times, so there’s still uncertainty about its true reward distribution.

2. **Exploration**: Many buttons (green, yellow, orange, black, white) have been pressed only 2 times, and their average rewards are all 0.5. These buttons could potentially have higher rewards, but we need more data to confirm.

3. **Risk vs. Reward**: The **blue button** is the safest choice based on current data, but exploring other buttons could lead to higher rewards if they turn out to be better.

4. **Decision**: Given that we still have 62 time steps left, it’s worth exploring buttons that haven’t been pressed much to gather more information. However, since the **blue button** has shown the highest reward so far, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.

**Final Decision**: To maximize the total reward, we’ll prioritize exploitation of the **blue button** while keeping in mind the need for further exploration in later steps.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **High Average Reward Buttons**:  
   - Blue (0.5 avg, 4 presses)  
   - Green (0.5 avg, 2 presses)  
   - Yellow (0.5 avg, 2 presses)  
   - Orange (0.5 avg, 2 presses)  
   - Pink (0.5 avg, 18 presses)  
   - Black (0.5 avg, 2 presses)  
   - White (0.5 avg, 2 presses)  

2. **Low Average Reward Buttons**:  
   - Red (0.33 avg, 3 presses)  
   - Purple (0.0 avg, 2 presses)  
   - Brown (0.0 avg, 2 presses)  

3. **Exploration Needed**:  
   - Buttons like purple, brown, and red have been pressed fewer times and have lower average rewards. However, their true means could still be higher, so further exploration is needed.  

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: Focus on buttons with high average rewards (e.g., blue, green, yellow, orange, pink, black, white).  
- **Exploration**: Occasionally try buttons with fewer presses or low average rewards to gather more data.  

### Decision:
Given that pink has the highest number of presses (18) and a consistent average reward of 0.5, it’s a safe choice for exploitation. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider buttons like purple or brown, which have been pressed only twice and have a 0.0 average reward. They could potentially have higher true means.  

Since we’re only 39 time steps in, exploration is still valuable. Let’s explore a button with low presses and low average reward.

Given the current data, the **green button** is the best choice for exploitation, but we should also consider exploring under-sampled buttons. For now, let’s prioritize the **green button** to maximize immediate reward while keeping exploration in mind for future steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **blue (0.5)**, **green (0.5)**, **yellow (0.5)**, **orange (0.5)**, **black (0.5)**, **white (0.5)**, and **pink (0.5)**. These buttons have shown promising results, so pressing them again could yield good rewards.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **purple (0.0)** and **brown (0.0)** have been pressed only a few times and have shown no reward. However, their true means might be higher, and we need more data to confirm. Pressing them could reveal higher rewards.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only 46 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room for exploration. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown potential but haven’t been pressed enough to confirm their true value.

4. **Decision**: Among the buttons with high average rewards, **blue** has been pressed 8 times, which is more than the others (except pink). **Pink** has been pressed 18 times, so its average reward is well-established. **Green**, **yellow**, **orange**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed only 2-4 times, so their true means are less certain.

   Given this, **green** and **yellow** are good candidates for exploitation with further exploration, as they have high average rewards but fewer presses. However, **purple** and **brown** are worth exploring more since they have been pressed very little and could have higher true means.

5. **Final Choice**: To balance exploitation and exploration, I’ll choose a button with a high average reward but fewer presses. **Green** is a good choice since it has a high average reward (0.5) but has only been pressed 4 times.

   - **Blue** has the highest average reward (0.5555) and has been pressed 9 times, so its estimate is relatively reliable.  
   - **Pink** has an average reward of 0.5 and has been pressed 18 times, making it a strong contender.  
   - **Orange** has an average reward of 0.5 and has been pressed only 4 times, so there’s more uncertainty but potential for higher reward.  

2. **Explore vs. Exploit**:  
   - Buttons like **purple** (0.0 average, 3 presses) and **brown** (0.0 average, 2 presses) have low rewards but could be worth exploring further to confirm their low means.  
   - Buttons like **red**, **yellow**, **black**, and **white** have moderate rewards (0.3333) but have been pressed only 3 times each, so their estimates are less reliable.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Blue** is the most reliable high-reward button, but **orange** has the same average reward with fewer presses, making it a good candidate for exploration to confirm its potential.  
   - **Pink** is also a strong choice but has been pressed many times already, so its estimate is likely accurate.  

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, **orange** is a good choice to maximize potential reward while reducing uncertainty.

1. **Identify the buttons with the highest average rewards**:  
   - **Blue button**: 0.5555 (highest average reward, pressed 9 times)  
   - **Pink button**: 0.5 (second-highest average reward, pressed 18 times)  

2. **Consider the uncertainty**:  
   Buttons like **red**, **yellow**, **purple**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed only 3 times, so their average rewards might not be fully representative of their true means. However, their current averages are lower than **blue** and **pink**.  

3. **Evaluate less-pressed buttons**:  
   - **Green** and **orange** have been pressed 5 times each with an average reward of 0.4, which is lower than **blue** and **pink**.  
   - **Brown** has been pressed only 2 times with an average reward of 0.0, so it’s less promising.  

4. **Decision**:  
   The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.5555) and has been pressed a moderate number of times (9), making it a reliable choice. The **pink button** is also strong but has been pressed more frequently (18 times), so its potential for higher rewards might be diminishing.

3. **Decision**: Given that we have 45 time steps remaining, we should prioritize exploiting the buttons with the highest known rewards while still exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better options.

- **Blue button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
- **Pink button** also has a high average reward but has been pressed more frequently, so its potential for higher rewards might be lower compared to less explored buttons.
- **Green and Orange buttons** have decent average rewards and have been pressed fewer times compared to pink, making them good candidates for further exploration.

Considering the balance between exploitation and exploration, the **blue button** is the best choice at this stage due to its high average reward and moderate exploration.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons that have shown the highest average rewards so far and exploring other buttons that might have higher rewards but have been pressed fewer times. Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards are:
   - **Blue**: 0.5625 (pressed 16 times)
   - **Pink**: 0.5 (pressed 18 times)

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed fewer times and might have higher rewards than their current averages suggest. These include:
   - **Green**: 0.4 (pressed 5 times)
   - **Orange**: 0.4 (pressed 5 times)
   - **Red, Yellow, Black, White**: 0.3333 (pressed 3 times each)
   - **Purple, Brown**: 0.0 (pressed 3 and 2 times respectively)

3. **Decision**:
   - **Blue** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Pink** also has a high average reward but has been pressed more times than **Blue**, so its potential for higher rewards might be lower.
   - **Green** and **Orange** have decent average rewards and have been pressed fewer times, making them good candidates for exploration.

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, **Blue** seems like the best choice at this point because it has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be somewhat reliable, but not so many times that further exploration is unnecessary.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the buttons with the highest average rewards:**
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of 0.5882 (pressed 17 times)
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of 0.5 (pressed 18 times)

2. **Evaluate the confidence in these averages:**
   - The blue button has been pressed 17 times, which is a decent number of trials, giving us reasonable confidence in its average reward.
   - The pink button has been pressed 18 times, which is also a good number of trials, providing reasonable confidence in its average reward.

3. **Compare the top contenders:**
   - The blue button has a slightly higher average reward (0.5882 vs 0.5) compared to the pink button.

4. **Consider exploration vs exploitation:**
   - Since we have a limited number of time steps left (38 out of 100), it’s more beneficial to exploit the button with the highest known reward rather than exploring buttons with lower or unknown rewards.

Given this analysis, the **blue button** is the best choice to maximize the total reward.

- **Blue button** has the highest average reward (0.5555555555555556) and has been pressed 18 times, which is a reasonable number of trials to trust the average.
- **Pink button** has the second-highest average reward (0.5) and has also been pressed 18 times, making it a strong contender.
- **Green** and **Orange** buttons both have an average reward of 0.4, but they have been pressed fewer times (5 times each), so their averages might still be less reliable compared to blue and pink.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button** has the highest average reward (0.55) and has been pressed 20 times, so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Pink button** has the second-highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed 18 times, making it another good candidate.  
   - Buttons like **red**, **yellow**, **purple**, **black**, and **white** have lower average rewards and have been pressed fewer times, so they are less attractive for exploitation but could still be worth exploring.  
   - Buttons like **brown** and **purple** have an average reward of 0.0, which suggests they are unlikely to yield high rewards, but they have been pressed very few times, so there’s still uncertainty about their true means.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we have 35 time steps left, we should allocate some of these to explore buttons with fewer presses to reduce uncertainty. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown some potential or have not been explored enough.  
   - **Brown button** (pressed 2 times) and **purple button** (pressed 3 times) are the least explored and have the lowest average rewards. Exploring them further could help confirm if they are truly low-reward buttons or if their averages are just unlucky.  

3. **Final Decision**:  
   Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, the **blue button** remains the best choice for exploitation due to its high average reward. However, to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better buttons, we should also explore the least-pressed buttons with low rewards.  

Since **brown** and **purple** are the least explored and have the lowest rewards, we should prioritize one of them for exploration. Between the two, **brown** has been pressed even fewer times (only 2), so it’s the better choice for exploration.

### Analysis:
1. **Exploitation**:  
   - The **blue** and **pink** buttons have the highest average rewards (0.5) and have been pressed 22 and 18 times, respectively. These are strong candidates for exploitation.  
   - The **green** and **orange** buttons have average rewards of 0.4, which is lower than blue and pink but still decent. They have been pressed only 5 times each, so there’s some uncertainty about their true reward rates.  

2. **Exploration**:  
   - Buttons like **red**, **yellow**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed only 3 times each and have average rewards of 0.3333. These could potentially have higher rewards, but we need more data to confirm.  
   - The **purple** and **brown** buttons have been pressed 3 times each and have average rewards of 0.0. These seem less promising but still need further exploration to confirm their low reward rates.  

### Decision:
Given that we have 32 time steps remaining (100 - 68 = 32), we should focus on:  
- **Exploiting** the best-known buttons (blue and pink) to maximize immediate rewards.  
- **Exploring** buttons with fewer presses but decent potential (green and orange) to gather more data.  

Since blue and pink have the highest average rewards and are well-tested, we should prioritize them. However, to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better buttons, we can allocate some presses to green and orange.  

### Final Choice:
Given the high average reward and sufficient data, the **blue** button is the best choice for exploitation at this stage.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the top-performing buttons**:  
   - **Blue button**: Highest average reward (0.5217) with 23 presses, indicating a reliable estimate.  
   - **Pink button**: Second-highest average reward (0.5) with 18 presses, also a reliable estimate.  

2. **Consider under-explored buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **green** and **orange** have fewer presses (5 each) but the same average reward (0.4). They could potentially have higher true means but need more exploration.  
   - Buttons like **purple** and **brown** have 0 average reward but only 3 presses each, so their true means are still uncertain.  

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration**:  
   - **Exploitation**: Choose the **blue** button, as it has the highest average reward and a reliable estimate.  
   - **Exploration**: Consider **green** or **orange** to reduce uncertainty, but since their average rewards are lower than **blue**, it’s less optimal at this stage.  

Given the goal of maximizing total reward, the **blue** button is the best choice based on its high average reward and reliable estimate.

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **blue** and **pink**, both with an average reward of 0.5. These are strong candidates for exploitation.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red**, **yellow**, **purple**, **brown**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed only 3 times each, and their average rewards are relatively low or zero. However, since they have been pressed so few times, their true reward probabilities might be higher than what we've observed. **Green** and **orange** have been pressed 5 times each and have an average reward of 0.4, which is also worth considering for further exploration.

3. **Decision**: Given that we have 30 time steps left, we should prioritize exploiting the buttons with the highest known rewards while still allocating some steps to explore buttons that have been pressed fewer times.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Pink**: 0.5 (pressed 18 times)
   - **Blue**: 0.48 (pressed 25 times)
   - **Green** and **Orange**: 0.4 (pressed 5 times each)

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times (3 times each), and their average rewards are not yet reliable. These include:
   - **Red**: 0.3333
   - **Yellow**: 0.3333
   - **Purple**: 0.0
   - **Brown**: 0.0
   - **Black**: 0.3333
   - **White**: 0.3333

3. **Decision**:
   - **Pink** has the highest average reward (0.5), but it has been pressed 18 times, so its reward distribution is relatively well-understood.
   - **Blue** has a slightly lower average reward (0.48) but has been pressed 25 times, so its reward distribution is also well-understood.
   - **Green** and **Orange** have the same average reward (0.4) but have been pressed only 5 times each, so there is still some uncertainty about their true reward potential.
   - The buttons pressed only 3 times (Red, Yellow, Purple, Brown, Black, White) have not been explored enough, and their average rewards are either low or zero. However, they could still have higher true means that we haven’t discovered yet.

Given that we have 29 time steps left (100 - 71 = 29), it’s worth exploring the buttons with fewer presses to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially higher rewards. Among the under-explored buttons, **Green** and **Orange** are the most promising because they already have a decent average reward (0.4) and have been pressed only 5 times each.

To maximize the potential for higher rewards, I’ll choose **Green** next, as it has the same average reward as Orange but hasn’t been explored as much as Pink or Blue.

- **Pink** has the highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed a moderate number of times (18), so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
- **Blue** is also a good option with a high average reward (0.48) and has been pressed more frequently (25 times), but its reward is slightly lower than Pink.
- **Orange** has a decent average reward (0.4) but has been pressed only 5 times, so it could be worth exploring further.

Considering the balance between exploitation and exploration, **Pink** is the best choice for the next step as it has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be relatively confident in its performance.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue** and **Pink** have the highest average rewards so far (0.48 and 0.4737, respectively), making them strong candidates for exploitation.  
   - **Orange** also has a decent average reward (0.4), but it has been pressed fewer times compared to Blue and Pink.  
   - Buttons like **Purple** and **Brown** have an average reward of 0.0, but they have only been pressed 3 times each, so they might still be worth exploring.  

2. **Uncertainty in Less-Pressed Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **Red**, **Yellow**, **Black**, and **White** have average rewards of 0.3333, but they have only been pressed 3 times each. There’s still uncertainty about their true reward distributions.  
   - **Green** has an average reward of 0.3333 after 6 presses, which is lower than Blue, Pink, and Orange.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since **Blue** has the highest average reward (0.48) and has been pressed 25 times, it is a reliable choice for exploitation.  
   - **Pink** is close behind with an average reward of 0.4737, but it has been pressed 19 times, so it’s also a good candidate.  
   - **Orange** has a slightly lower average reward (0.4) but has been pressed only 5 times, so it might be worth exploring further.  

Given the goal of maximizing the total reward, **Blue** is the safest and most rewarding choice at this point, as it has the highest average reward and a sufficient number of trials to confirm its reliability.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Blue Button**:  
   - Pressed 26 times with an average reward of **0.4615**.  
   - This is the highest average reward so far, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Pink Button**:  
   - Pressed 20 times with an average reward of **0.45**.  
   - This is the second-highest average reward, also a good candidate for exploitation.

3. **Orange Button**:  
   - Pressed 5 times with an average reward of **0.4**.  
   - Fewer presses compared to blue and pink, so there’s potential for higher reward if explored further.

4. **Other Buttons**:  
   - Green, red, yellow, black, and white have similar average rewards of **0.3333** but fewer presses.  
   - Purple and brown have **0.0** average rewards, indicating they are unlikely to yield high rewards.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: Focus on buttons with the highest known rewards (blue and pink).  
- **Exploration**: Test buttons with fewer presses but decent rewards (orange) to confirm their potential.  

### Decision:
Given the remaining 25 time steps, the **blue button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, making it the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate rewards. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider the **orange button** due to its fewer presses and decent average reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button** has the highest average reward (0.48148) and has been pressed 27 times, indicating a relatively reliable estimate.  
   - **Orange button** has a high average reward (0.4) but has only been pressed 5 times, so its true reward potential is less certain.  
   - **Pink button** has a decent average reward (0.45) and has been pressed 20 times, making it a reliable choice.  
   - Other buttons (e.g., purple, brown) have low or zero average rewards and are less promising.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   - Buttons like **orange** have fewer presses and a high average reward, so exploring them further could yield better results if their true reward is higher than currently estimated.  

3. **Decision**:

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button** has the highest average reward (0.48148148148148145) and has been pressed 27 times, indicating it’s a reliable choice.  
   - **Pink button** has the second-highest average reward (0.45) and has been pressed 20 times, also a strong candidate.  
   - Other buttons like **green, red, yellow, orange, black, and white** have lower average rewards (0.3333333333333333) but have been pressed fewer times, so they might still have potential.  
   - **Purple** and **brown** buttons have an average reward of 0.0, making them less attractive unless we want to explore further.

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 23 time steps left (100 - 77 = 23), we should focus more on **exploitation** rather than exploration to maximize rewards.  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward and is the most reliable choice based on the data.

3. **Final Decision**:  
   Given the limited time and the need to maximize rewards, the **blue button** is the best choice.

2. **Evaluate less-pressed buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **green**, **red**, **yellow**, **orange**, **black**, and **white** have an average reward of 0.3333, but they have been pressed only 3–6 times. While they might have higher true means, the data is insufficient to confirm this.  
   - Buttons like **purple** and **brown** have an average reward of 0.0, but they have only been pressed 3 times each. They could still have higher true means, but the risk is higher.

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration**:  
   - Since we have only 22 time steps left (100 - 78 = 22), we should prioritize **exploitation** (choosing the best-known option) over **exploration** (trying less-known options).

2. **Compare the top buttons**:  
   Both blue and pink buttons have very similar average rewards. However, the pink button has a slightly higher average reward (0.45 vs 0.448).  

3. **Consider exploration**:  
   Buttons like green, red, yellow, orange, black, and white have been pressed fewer times (3-6 times) and have an average reward of 0.333.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Pink Button**:  
   - Pressed 21 times with an average reward of **0.47619**.  
   - This is the highest average reward among all buttons.  

2. **Blue Button**:  
   - Pressed 29 times with an average reward of **0.44828**.  
   - The second-highest average reward, but slightly lower than pink.  

3. **Other Buttons**:  
   - Green, red, yellow, orange, black, and white have similar average rewards of **0.33333**, but they have been pressed fewer times (3–6 times).  
   - Purple and brown have an average reward of **0.0**, indicating they are likely not worth pressing further.  

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: Focus on the pink button, as it has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of trials to estimate its mean.  
- **Exploration**: Since we still have 20 time steps left, we can explore buttons like green, red, yellow, orange, black, and white a bit more to confirm their lower rewards or potentially discover a higher mean.  

### Decision:
Given the pink button’s superior performance so far, it is the best choice for exploitation. However, to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better button, we can allocate a few trials to explore the less-pressed buttons with moderate rewards (e.g., green, red, yellow, orange, black, white).  

For now, the pink button is the safest and most rewarding choice.

- **Blue button** has been pressed 29 times with an average reward of 0.448.
- **Pink button** has been pressed 22 times with an average reward of 0.4545.

Both the **blue** and **pink** buttons have the highest average rewards, but the **pink** button has a slightly higher average reward. However, the **blue** button has been pressed more times, which gives us more confidence in its average reward estimate.

The other buttons have either lower average rewards or have been pressed very few times, making their average rewards less reliable.

Given that we want to maximize the reward and the **pink** button has shown a slightly higher average reward with fewer presses, it might still have potential for higher rewards. However, the **blue** button is a safer choice given its consistent performance and higher number of presses.

From the summary:
- **Blue button** has the highest average reward (0.48387) and has been pressed 31 times.
- **Pink button** has the second-highest average reward (0.43478) and has been pressed 23 times.
- Other buttons (green, red, yellow, orange, black, white) have similar average rewards around 0.3333, but with fewer presses, indicating less certainty about their true reward potential.
- **Purple** and **brown** buttons have an average reward of 0.0, suggesting they are less promising.

Given the limited remaining time steps (16 out of 100), it's more beneficial to focus on exploiting the buttons with the highest known rewards rather than exploring further. The **blue button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed more times, making it a more reliable choice.

### Analysis:
1. **Exploitation**:
   - **Blue button**: Highest average reward (0.46875) with 32 presses.
   - **Pink button**: Second-highest average reward (0.43478) with 23 presses.

2. **Exploration**:
   - Buttons like **green, red, yellow, orange, black, white** have been pressed only 3-6 times, so their true reward potential is less certain.
   - Buttons like **purple** and **brown** have been pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.0, but this could be due to chance, and further exploration might reveal higher rewards.

### Strategy:
- **Prioritize exploitation** since we only have 15 time steps left. The blue button has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be relatively confident in its performance.
- **Minimal exploration** can be done on buttons with low presses but non-zero rewards, like green, red, yellow, orange, black, and white, but only if there’s a strong reason to believe they might outperform blue or pink.

### Decision:
Given the limited time steps remaining, the best strategy is to continue pressing the **blue button** as it has the highest average reward and a sufficient number of presses to be confident in its performance.

1. **Identify the top-performing buttons**:  
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of **0.4545** (highest so far).  
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of **0.4348** (second highest).  

2. **Evaluate the number of trials**:  
   - Blue button has been pressed **33 times**, which is a decent number of trials to estimate its mean reward.  
   - Pink button has been pressed **23 times**, also a reasonable number of trials.  

3. **Consider under-explored buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **green**, **orange**, **red**, **yellow**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed only **3–6 times**, which is insufficient to accurately estimate their mean rewards.  
   - Buttons like **purple** and **brown** have been pressed **3 times** each and have shown **0.0** average reward, making them less promising.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Since **blue** has the highest average reward and has been sufficiently explored, it is the safest choice to maximize immediate reward.  
   - However, exploring under-explored buttons like **green** or **orange** could reveal higher rewards, but this is riskier with limited time remaining.  

Given the goal is to maximize total reward in the remaining **14 time steps**, the best choice is to exploit the button with the highest known reward.

   - **Pink button**: Second-highest average reward (0.4348) with 23 presses.

2. **Exploration**:

   - **Purple and Brown buttons**: Both have an average reward of 0.0 with 3 presses each, indicating they are likely not good choices, but further exploration could confirm this.

### Strategy:
- **Focus on Exploitation**: Given the limited time steps remaining (12), it's more beneficial to exploit the buttons with the highest known rewards rather than spending too much time exploring buttons with low or uncertain rewards.
- **Minimal Exploration**: We can allocate a small number of presses to the buttons with fewer trials (Green, Red, Yellow, Orange, Black, White) to ensure we're not missing out on a potentially better option.

### Decision:
- **Primary Choice**: Blue button, as it has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be relatively confident in its performance.
- **Secondary Choice**: If we want to explore slightly, we could allocate 1-2 presses to one of the less-pressed buttons with moderate average rewards (e.g., Green or Orange).

The other buttons have either lower average rewards or insufficient data to make a confident choice. Given that we only have 7 time steps left, it's best to stick with the button that has consistently provided the highest average reward.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Blue button** has the highest average reward (0.475) and a substantial number of trials (40), making it a reliable choice.
2. **Pink button** is a close second but has a slightly lower average reward and fewer trials compared to the blue button.
3. The remaining buttons either have lower average rewards or insufficient data to justify choosing them over the blue button.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performers**:  
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of **0.5** over **42 presses**. This is the highest average reward so far, and it has been pressed enough times to be relatively reliable.  
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of **0.4348** over **23 presses**. This is the second-highest average reward, but it has been pressed fewer times than the blue button.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - Buttons like **purple**, **brown**, **red**, **yellow**, **orange**, **black**, **white**, and **green** have been pressed only **3–6 times** and have lower or similar average rewards. There’s a chance some of these buttons might have higher true means, but the risk of choosing them is higher given the limited data.  
   - Since we only have **5 time steps left**, the focus should be on **exploitation** rather than exploration.

3. **Decision**:  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be a reliable choice.  
   - The **pink button** is a close second, but the blue button’s higher average reward and larger sample size make it the better choice.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the buttons with the highest average rewards**:  
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of 0.4884 (highest among all buttons).  
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of 0.4348 (second highest).  

2. **Consider the number of times each button has been pressed**:  
   - Blue button has been pressed 43 times, which is significantly more than the pink button (23 times). This suggests the blue button's average reward is more reliable due to a larger sample size.  

3. **Evaluate under-explored buttons**:  
   - Buttons like green, red, yellow, orange, black, and white have been pressed only 3–6 times, but their average rewards are all 0.3333, which is lower than both blue and pink.  
   - Purple and brown buttons have an average reward of 0.0, making them poor choices.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The **blue button** has the highest average reward and a sufficiently large sample size to trust its performance. It is the best choice to maximize the remaining rewards.

1. **Exploitation**: Based on the current data, the **blue button** has the highest average reward of 0.5, making it the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons (e.g., purple, brown) have been pressed only 3 times and have an average reward of 0.0, but this could be due to low sample size. However, with only 3 time steps left, exploring these buttons is risky as it may not yield better results than sticking with the blue button.

3. **Pink button**: It has a decent average reward of 0.43478260869565216 and has been pressed 23 times, but it is still lower than the blue button's average.
