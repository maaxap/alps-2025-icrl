To maximize the total reward, we should prioritize exploring buttons that have not been pressed yet, as they could potentially have higher rewards. However, since the blue button has already shown a positive reward, it is also a strong candidate for exploitation.

A balanced approach between exploration and exploitation is key. Since we have only 100 time steps, we should not spend too much time exploring buttons that might yield low rewards.

- The blue button has already shown a positive reward, but we should also explore other buttons to gather more information.  
- Choosing the red button allows us to explore a new option while keeping the possibility of returning to the blue button later if it continues to yield good rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Data Analysis**:  
   - **Blue** and **Red** buttons have been pressed once each and both yielded a reward of 1.0.  
   - **Green** button was pressed once and yielded a reward of 0.0.  
   - All other buttons (**Yellow, Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink, Black, White**) have not been pressed yet.

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Exploitation**: Based on current data, **Blue** and **Red** seem promising since they gave the highest rewards.  
   - **Exploration**: We have 97 time steps left, and we need to gather more information about the other buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options.

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since **Blue** and **Red** have the same average reward, we can choose either one for exploitation.  
   - However, to balance exploration, we should also consider trying one of the untested buttons.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Let’s exploit one of the known good buttons (**Blue** or **Red**) to maximize immediate reward.  
   - For this step, we’ll choose **Blue** since it has the same performance as **Red** so far.

From the summary:
- **Red button** has the highest average reward (0.6667) among the buttons that have been pressed more than once.
- **Yellow button** has a perfect average reward (1.0), but it has only been pressed once, so we have less confidence in its true mean.
- **Blue button** has a decent average reward (0.5) but has been pressed twice, giving us some confidence in its performance.
- **Green button** has a low average reward (0.0) and has been pressed once.
- The remaining buttons (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards.

**Strategy:**
1. **Exploitation:** Prioritize buttons with high average rewards and sufficient data (like red and blue).
2. **Exploration:** Occasionally try untested buttons to gather more information.

Given the current data, the **red button** is the most reliable choice for exploitation, as it has the highest average reward among the tested buttons. However, to ensure we don't miss out on potentially better buttons, we should also consider exploring untested buttons.

- **Green button** has a low average reward (0.0) and has been pressed only once.
- All other buttons (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed yet, so we have no information about their rewards.

Given that we have 91 time steps remaining, it's important to explore the unexplored buttons to gather more information. However, since the **yellow button** has shown the highest reward so far, it's a strong candidate for exploitation. 

To balance exploration and exploitation, let's choose the **yellow button** again to confirm its high reward potential.

- **Yellow button** has a good average reward (0.6667) with 3 presses.
- **Blue button** has a moderate average reward (0.5) with 2 presses.

Given that we have 90 time steps remaining, it's important to explore the unexplored buttons to understand their potential rewards. However, since the red button has shown the best performance so far, it's a strong candidate for exploitation.

**Strategy:**
1. **Exploit** the red button since it has the highest average reward.
2. **Explore** the unexplored buttons to gather more information.

Since the red button has the highest average reward and has been pressed more times than the others, it’s a safe choice to maximize immediate reward while we still have time to explore later.

1. **Yellow Button**: Highest average reward (0.6667) with 3 presses.  
2. **Red Button**: Second-highest average reward (0.6) with 5 presses.  
3. **Blue Button**: Average reward (0.5) with 2 presses.  
4. **Green Button**: Lowest average reward (0.0) with 1 press.  
5. **Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink, Black, White Buttons**: No presses yet, so their rewards are unknown.

- **Exploitation**: The yellow button has the highest average reward so far, so pressing it again is a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.  
- **Exploration**: The unexplored buttons (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) could potentially have higher rewards than the yellow button. We should explore them to gather more information.

3. **Balancing Act**: While purple has the highest average reward, it has only been pressed once, so its true mean is uncertain. Yellow and red are more reliable but have been pressed multiple times. The unexplored buttons (orange, brown, pink, black, white) are completely unknown and could be worth trying.

4. **Decision**: Given that we are still early in the process and have many unexplored buttons, it’s a good strategy to explore one of them. Let’s choose **orange** as the next button to press, as it has not been tried yet.

   - **Black**
   - **White**

Given that we have only 18 out of 100 time steps completed, there is still a significant portion of the game left. It’s important to explore the unpressed buttons to gather more information, as they might yield higher rewards than the currently exploited buttons.

3. **Decision**: 
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward so far, but it has been pressed 4 times, which is relatively more than the others.
   - **Brown**, **Pink**, **Black**, and **White** have not been pressed at all, and their potential rewards are completely unknown.

To balance exploitation and exploration, we should prioritize exploring one of the unpressed buttons to gather more data. Let’s choose one of them randomly or systematically. For this step, let’s choose **Brown** as it is the first unpressed button in the list.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **orange**: 4 presses, average reward 1.0
   - **brown**: 1 press, average reward 1.0
   - **yellow**: 3 presses, average reward 0.6667
   - **purple**: 3 presses, average reward 0.6667
   - **red**: 5 presses, average reward 0.6

2. **Exploration**: The buttons that have been pressed fewer times (or not at all) are:
   - **pink**: 0 presses
   - **black**: 0 presses
   - **white**: 0 presses
   - **green**: 1 press, average reward 0.0
   - **blue**: 2 presses, average reward 0.5

3. **Decision**:
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward (1.0) and has been pressed 4 times, which is a reasonable number of trials to trust its performance. However, we should also consider exploring buttons with fewer presses to avoid missing out on potentially better options.
   - **Brown** also has an average reward of 1.0 but has only been pressed once, so its true reward distribution is less certain.
   - **Pink**, **black**, and **white** have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards. Exploring one of these could be beneficial.

4. **Trade-off**: Given that we have 81 time steps remaining, it’s still early enough to explore. However, since **orange** has shown consistently high rewards, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation. Meanwhile, exploring **pink**, **black**, or **white** could reveal even better options.

**Final Decision**: To balance exploitation and exploration, I’ll choose **orange** for now, as it has the highest proven reward, but I’ll keep in mind to explore the untested buttons in subsequent steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **orange**: 1.0 (pressed 5 times)
   - **brown**: 1.0 (pressed 1 time)

2. **Exploration**: The buttons that haven't been pressed at all are **pink**, **black**, and **white**. These could potentially have high rewards, but we don’t know yet.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only 20 time steps in (out of 100), it’s still early to focus solely on exploitation. We should explore some of the untested buttons to gather more information.

4. **Decision**: Given the high average reward of **orange** (1.0) and the fact that it’s been pressed 5 times, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation. However, **brown** also has a high average reward (1.0) but has only been pressed once, so it’s worth exploring further. Additionally, **pink**, **black**, and **white** are completely unexplored and could be worth trying.

Since **brown** has shown a high reward but has been pressed only once, it’s a good candidate for further exploration to confirm its potential.

   - **Brown** and **Pink** and **White** have the highest average rewards (1.0), but they have been pressed only 1-2 times. This suggests they might be promising, but we need more data to confirm their true potential.  
   - **Orange** has a high average reward (0.857) and has been pressed 7 times, making it a more reliable choice.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - Buttons like **Brown**, **Pink**, and **White** have high rewards but very few samples. Pressing them again could help confirm their potential.  
   - **Orange** is a safer bet with a high reward and more samples, but we might miss out on potentially better buttons if we don’t explore further.  

3. **Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - **Green** and **Black** have been pressed only once and have low rewards, but they could still be worth exploring to ensure they aren’t better than they seem.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Given the high average reward and moderate number of samples, **Orange** is a strong candidate for exploitation. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing **Brown**, **Pink**, or **White** again to gather more data.  

Since **Brown** has the highest average reward and has only been pressed twice, it’s a good candidate for further exploration.

2. **Exploration**:  
   - Buttons like **Brown**, **Pink**, and **White** have high average rewards but very few samples. Testing them further could reveal if they are consistently high-reward buttons.  
   - Buttons like **Green** and **Black** have low average rewards (0.0) but have only been pressed once, so they might still be worth exploring.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since **Brown**, **Pink**, and **White** have the highest average rewards but limited data, it’s worth exploring them further to confirm their potential.  
   - **Orange** is a safe bet for exploitation, but we should also explore the high-reward, low-sample buttons to maximize long-term gains.  

Given the current data, **Brown** has the highest average reward (1.0) and has only been pressed 3 times, making it a strong candidate for exploration.

3. **Balancing Act**:

   - **Blue** and **Pink** have moderate average rewards (0.5) and have been pressed 2 times each, so they are less attractive.  
   - **Green** and **Black** have average rewards of 0.0, making them poor choices unless we need to explore them further.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we still have 66 time steps left, it’s worth exploring buttons with high potential but fewer presses. **Brown** stands out as a good candidate because it has a high average reward (0.75) but has only been pressed 4 times.  

3. **Final Decision**:  
   Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, **Brown** is the best choice for this step.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **orange**: 0.8 (pressed 10 times)
   - **purple**: 0.6667 (pressed 3 times)
   - **brown**: 0.6667 (pressed 6 times)
   - **white**: 0.6667 (pressed 3 times)

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times, and their true reward potential is still uncertain:
   - **blue**: 0.5 (pressed 2 times)
   - **green**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)
   - **pink**: 0.5 (pressed 2 times)
   - **black**: 0.0 (pressed 1 time)

3. **Decision**: 
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward (0.8) and has been pressed a moderate number of times (10), making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - However, **purple**, **white**, and **brown** also have high rewards but have been pressed fewer times, so there’s potential for higher rewards if their true means are higher than currently observed.
   - **Black** and **green** have low rewards but have been pressed very few times, so exploring them could reveal higher rewards.

4. **Trade-off**: Given that we have 62 time steps remaining, it’s still worth exploring buttons with fewer presses to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially higher rewards. However, **orange** remains the safest bet for exploitation.

**Final Choice**: Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, **orange** is the best choice at this stage due to its consistently high reward and moderate exploration.

2. **Consider exploration**:  
   - Buttons like **Black** (pressed once with 0.0 reward) and **Green** (pressed twice with 0.0 reward) might still have potential, but their low rewards so far make them less attractive.  
   - Buttons like **Blue**, **Yellow**, and **Pink** have moderate rewards (0.5) but have been pressed only 2–4 times, so they could still be worth exploring.  

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration**:  
   - **Orange** is the clear leader in terms of reward, but pressing it again might not yield much new information.  
   - **Purple**, **Brown**, and **White** are promising but have been pressed fewer times, so exploring them further could be beneficial.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given that **Orange** has the highest reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should also explore buttons with fewer presses but decent rewards, like **Purple**, **Brown**, or **White**.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Orange**: 0.6923 (pressed 13 times)
   - **Purple**: 0.6667 (pressed 3 times)
   - **Brown**: 0.6667 (pressed 6 times)
   - **White**: 0.6667 (pressed 3 times)
   - **Red**: 0.6 (pressed 5 times)

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times and could potentially have higher rewards:
   - **Blue**: 0.5 (pressed 2 times)
   - **Pink**: 0.5 (pressed 2 times)
   - **Green**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)
   - **Black**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)

3. **Strategy**: Since we are only 42 time steps in (out of 100), there is still room for exploration. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise but haven't been pressed enough to confirm their potential.

Given this, **Purple** and **White** are strong candidates for exploitation since they have high average rewards but have been pressed relatively few times (3 times each). **Orange** is also a strong candidate, but it has already been pressed 13 times, so its potential is better understood.

To balance exploitation and exploration, I will choose **Purple** next, as it has a high average reward and hasn't been pressed much.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward (0.6923) and has been pressed 13 times, which is a good sample size.  
   - **Brown** and **White** also have high average rewards (0.6667) but have been pressed fewer times (6 and 3, respectively).  
   - Buttons like **Green** and **Black** have an average reward of 0.0, but they have only been pressed 2 times each, so they might still be worth exploring.  

2. **Prioritizing High Rewards**:  
   - **Orange** is the clear leader in terms of both average reward and sample size, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.  

3. **Exploring Under-sampled Buttons**:  
   - **Green** and **Black** have low average rewards but very few samples. Exploring them could reveal higher rewards, but the risk is high.  
   - **Brown** and **White** are also worth considering since they have high rewards but fewer samples compared to **Orange**.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Given the goal of maximizing total reward, **Orange** is the safest and most rewarding choice based on current data. However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should occasionally explore under-sampled buttons with high potential, like **Brown** or **White**.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the best-performing buttons so far**:
   - **Orange**: 14 presses, average reward 0.642857
   - **Brown**: 6 presses, average reward 0.666667
   - **White**: 3 presses, average reward 0.666667
   - **Red**: 5 presses, average reward 0.6

2. **Consider exploration**:
   - Buttons like **blue**, **green**, **pink**, and **black** have been pressed only 2 times each, and their average rewards are either 0.5 or 0.0. There’s a chance they might perform better with more presses, so exploring them could be beneficial.

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration**:
   - Since we’re only 44 time steps in (out of 100), there’s still room for exploration. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise but haven’t been fully explored yet.

4. **Decision**:
   - **Brown** and **White** have the highest average rewards (0.666667) but have been pressed relatively fewer times (6 and 3, respectively). They are good candidates for exploitation.
   - **Orange** has a slightly lower average reward (0.642857) but has been pressed the most (14 times), so it’s less risky but also less likely to yield significantly higher rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the best-performing buttons so far**:  
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward (0.642857) with 14 presses.  
   - **Brown** is close behind with an average reward of 0.636364 and 11 presses.  
   - **Red** has an average reward of 0.6 with 5 presses.  

2. **Consider exploration**:  
   - Buttons like **blue**, **pink**, **green**, and **black** have been pressed only 2 times each, and their average rewards are either 0.5 or 0.0.  
   - **Yellow**, **purple**, and **white** have been pressed 4 times each with an average reward of 0.5, which is lower than the top performers.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Orange** and **brown** are the top performers, but **orange** has a slightly higher average reward and has been pressed more times, making it a reliable choice.  
   - However, **brown** has been pressed fewer times than **orange**, so there’s a chance it could perform even better with more exploration.  

Given the goal of maximizing total reward, **orange** is the safest and most rewarding choice at this stage.

### Analysis of Past Data:
1. **Orange button**: Highest average reward (0.6667) with 15 presses.  
2. **Brown button**: Second-highest average reward (0.6364) with 11 presses.  
3. **Red button**: Third-highest average reward (0.6) with 5 presses.  
4. **Blue, Yellow, Purple, Pink, White buttons**: Average reward of 0.5 with 2–4 presses.  
5. **Green and Black buttons**: Average reward of 0.0 with 2 presses.  

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The orange button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
- **Exploration**: Buttons like green and black have been pressed only twice and have shown no reward, but they could still have higher means (we don’t have enough data yet).  

### Decision:
Given that we’re only 51 time steps in (with 49 remaining), it’s still worth exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options. However, since the orange button has consistently shown the highest reward, it’s a safe choice for now.

   - **green**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)
   - **black**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)

3. **Decision**: Given that we have 48 time steps remaining, we should prioritize buttons that have shown high rewards but haven't been explored exhaustively.

Considering the balance between exploitation and exploration, the **orange** button remains the most promising choice based on its high average reward and the need to maximize immediate gains.

   - **Orange** and **Brown** buttons have the highest average rewards (0.647 and 0.636, respectively) and have been pressed a moderate number of times (17 and 11, respectively). These are strong candidates for exploitation.  
   - **Red** has a high average reward (0.6) but has only been pressed 5 times, so it might be worth exploring further.  
   - Buttons like **Green** and **Black** have an average reward of 0.0 but have only been pressed 2 times each. They could be worth exploring to see if their true rewards are higher.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we still have 47 time steps left, it’s beneficial to explore buttons that have been pressed fewer times but show potential. **Green** and **Black** are good candidates for exploration because they have low average rewards but very few samples.  

3. **Final Decision**:  
   Given the need to balance exploitation and exploration, I’ll prioritize exploring **Green** or **Black** to gather more data. Between the two, **Green** has been pressed slightly more often, so I’ll choose **Green** next.

   - **Brown button**: Highest average reward (0.6923) with 13 presses.  
   - **Orange button**: Second-highest average reward (0.6111) with 18 presses.

   - **Green and black buttons**: Average reward of 0.0, indicating they are likely not good choices.  

2. **Prioritizing High-Reward Buttons**:  
   - The **brown button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed fewer times than the **orange button**. This suggests it might still have potential for higher rewards or needs more exploration to confirm its true mean.  

3. **Exploration of Under-Pressed Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **blue, pink, and white** have been pressed only 2-4 times, so their true means are less certain. However, their average rewards are not significantly higher than the **brown button**.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the **brown button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed fewer times than the **orange button**, it is a strong candidate for exploitation.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Orange** and **Brown** buttons have the highest average rewards (0.611 and 0.6, respectively) and have been pressed a moderate number of times (18 and 15, respectively). These are strong candidates for exploitation.  
   - Buttons like **Blue**, **Red**, **Yellow**, **Purple**, and **Pink** have average rewards of 0.5, which is lower than **Orange** and **Brown**.  
   - Buttons like **Green** and **Black** have an average reward of 0.0, making them poor choices unless we want to explore further.  

2. **Exploration Consideration**:  
   - Buttons like **Pink**, **Blue**, and **White** have been pressed only 2-4 times, so there’s still uncertainty about their true reward distributions. However, their current average rewards are not promising enough to prioritize them over **Orange** or **Brown**.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward (0.611) and has been pressed 18 times, which is a good balance between exploitation and confidence in its reward distribution.  
   - **Brown** is a close second with an average reward of 0.6, but **Orange** has a slightly higher average and a similar number of presses.

   - **Green** and **black** buttons have low or zero rewards and have been pressed a few times, so they are less likely to be optimal.  

3. **Balance Exploitation and Exploration**:  
   - Since **brown** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, **orange** has been pressed more frequently and still has a high average reward, making it a reliable choice.

   - **pink** (pressed 2 times, average reward: 0.5)
   - **black** (pressed 2 times, average reward: 0.0)
   - **green** (pressed 3 times, average reward: 0.0)

3. **Decision**: Given that we have 38 time steps remaining, we should prioritize buttons with high average rewards but also explore buttons that haven't been pressed much to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better options.

   - **brown** has the highest average reward (0.625) and has been pressed a moderate number of times (16), so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **orange** is also a good candidate, but its average reward is slightly lower than **brown**.
   - **blue** and **pink** are worth exploring since they have been pressed only twice and have an average reward of 0.5, which is not bad.

4. **Final Choice**: Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, **brown** is the best choice because it has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be reliable, but not so many times that we should stop exploring other options.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **brown**: 0.5789 (pressed 19 times)
   - **orange**: 0.55 (pressed 20 times)
   - All other buttons have an average reward of 0.5, except **green** and **black**, which have 0.0.

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times, such as **blue** (2 times), **pink** (2 times), **black** (2 times), and **green** (3 times). These buttons could potentially have higher rewards, but we don’t have enough data yet.

3. **Decision**: Given that we have 34 time steps remaining (100 - 66 = 34), we should focus more on **exploitation** since we have limited time left. However, we should still explore buttons with very few presses to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option.

   - **brown** has the highest average reward (0.5789) and has been pressed 19 times, which is a reasonable number of trials.
   - **orange** is close behind with an average reward of 0.55 and has been pressed 20 times.

4. **Final Choice**: Since **brown** has the highest average reward and we’ve already explored it enough to trust its performance, it’s the best choice for exploitation.

1. **Exploitation**: The **brown button** has the highest average reward (0.619) and has been pressed 21 times, indicating a relatively stable estimate. It’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
2. **Exploration**: Some buttons (e.g., blue, pink, black) have been pressed only 2 times, and their average rewards are either promising (blue, pink: 0.5) or poor (black: 0.0). Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards or confirm their low value.  
3. **Current Best**: The brown button is the clear leader in terms of average reward, but we should also consider the orange button, which has a slightly lower average reward (0.55) but has been pressed 20 times, suggesting a stable estimate.  

Given that we have 32 time steps remaining (100 - 68 = 32), we should prioritize exploitation of the brown button while still exploring other buttons occasionally. However, for this step, the brown button is the safest and most rewarding choice based on current data.

   - **Green** and **black** buttons have an average reward of 0.0, making them less attractive unless we want to explore further.  

2. **Prioritizing High-Reward Buttons**:

3. **Exploring Under-Tested Buttons**:  
   Buttons like **blue**, **pink**, and **white** have been pressed only 2–4 times, so their true reward potential is still uncertain. Exploring these could yield higher rewards if their true means are higher than observed.  

4. **Decision**:

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Brown Button**:  
   - Pressed 24 times with an average reward of **0.625**.  
   - This is the highest average reward observed so far, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Orange Button**:  
   - Pressed 20 times with an average reward of **0.55**.  
   - A solid option but slightly lower than the brown button.

3. **Blue, Red, Yellow, Purple, Pink, White Buttons**:  
   - All have an average reward of **0.5**, which is lower than the brown and orange buttons.  
   - These buttons have been pressed fewer times (2-6 times), so there’s potential for higher rewards, but the risk is higher.

4. **Green and Black Buttons**:  
   - Average rewards of **0.0**, indicating they are unlikely to yield good rewards.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: Focus on the brown button, as it has the highest observed average reward.  
- **Exploration**: Since we still have 28 time steps left, we can afford to explore buttons with fewer presses (like blue, pink, or yellow) to confirm their potential. However, given the limited time, prioritizing the brown button is safer.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Brown button** has the highest average reward (0.5769) and has been pressed 26 times, indicating a good balance of exploration and exploitation.  
   - **Orange button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.55) but has been pressed 20 times, suggesting it’s also a strong candidate.  
   - Other buttons like **blue**, **red**, **yellow**, **purple**, **pink**, and **white** have lower or equal average rewards and fewer presses, making them less attractive for exploitation.  
   - **Green** and **black** buttons have an average reward of 0.0, making them poor choices unless further exploration is needed.  

2. **Remaining Time Steps**:  
   With 26 time steps left, we should focus on exploiting the best-performing buttons while leaving some room for exploration if necessary.  

3. **Decision**:  
   Given the data, the **brown button** has the highest average reward and has been sufficiently explored. It’s the best choice for exploitation at this stage.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Brown Button**: Highest average reward (0.5556) with 27 presses.  
2. **Orange Button**: Second-highest average reward (0.55) with 20 presses.  
3. **Blue, Red, Yellow, Purple, Pink, White Buttons**: All have an average reward of 0.5, but with fewer presses (2-6 times).  
4. **Green and Black Buttons**: Average reward of 0.0, indicating low potential.  

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: Focus on buttons with high average rewards (brown and orange).  
- **Exploration**: Test buttons with fewer presses but decent average rewards (blue, red, yellow, purple, pink, white) to confirm their potential.  

### Decision:
Given that the brown button has the highest average reward and has been pressed more times than the orange button, it is a strong candidate for exploitation. However, to ensure we are not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should also explore buttons with fewer presses but similar average rewards.  

Since the brown button has already been pressed 27 times and has a slightly higher average reward than the orange button, we will prioritize it for the next press.

1. **Identify the buttons with the highest average rewards so far:**
   - **Brown button:** Average reward of 0.5714 (highest among all buttons).
   - **Orange button:** Average reward of 0.55 (second highest).

2. **Consider the number of times each button has been pressed:**
   - **Brown button:** Pressed 28 times (most frequently).
   - **Orange button:** Pressed 20 times (second most frequently).

3. **Evaluate buttons with fewer presses but decent rewards:**
   - **Blue, Red, Yellow, Purple, Pink, White:** All have an average reward of 0.5, but they have been pressed fewer times (2-4 times).
   - **Green and Black:** Average reward of 0.0, indicating they are less promising.

4. **Strategy:**
   - **Exploitation:** Focus on the brown button since it has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be relatively reliable.
   - **Exploration:** Consider pressing buttons like blue, red, yellow, purple, pink, or white a few more times to confirm their reward potential, but prioritize exploitation given the limited remaining time steps.

5. **Decision:**
   - Given the remaining 24 time steps, prioritize the **brown button** for exploitation, as it has the highest observed reward and has been pressed sufficiently to be a reliable choice.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Average Rewards**:  
   - The **orange** button has the highest average reward (0.55) among all buttons, followed closely by **brown** (0.542857).  
   - Buttons like **blue**, **red**, **yellow**, **purple**, **pink**, and **white** have average rewards of 0.5, which is slightly lower.  
   - **Green** and **black** have average rewards of 0.0, making them poor choices.

2. **Uncertainty in Estimates**:  
   - Buttons like **blue**, **pink**, and **black** have been pressed only 2 times, so their average rewards are less reliable. There could be higher potential rewards if we explore them further.  
   - **Orange** and **brown** have been pressed 20 and 35 times, respectively, so their average rewards are more reliable.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - Since we have only 17 time steps left, we should prioritize **exploitation** (choosing buttons with higher known rewards) over **exploration** (testing buttons with fewer presses).  
   - **Orange** has the highest average reward and a relatively reliable estimate, making it the best choice for exploitation.

4. **Final Decision**:  
   - Given the limited time and the reliable high reward of the **orange** button, it is the optimal choice.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the average rewards**:  
   - **Orange**: 0.5238 (highest average reward)  
   - **Brown**: 0.5116 (second highest)  
   - All other buttons have an average reward of 0.5 or 0.0.  

2. **Consider the number of trials**:  
   - **Orange** has been pressed 21 times, which is a reasonable sample size to trust its average reward.  
   - **Brown** has been pressed 43 times, which is a larger sample size, but its average reward is slightly lower than **Orange**.  

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The **Orange** button has the highest average reward and a sufficient number of trials to trust its estimate. Therefore, it is the best choice to maximize the expected reward.
