Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The blue and red buttons have both been pressed once and yielded a reward of 1.0, which is the highest observed so far. These are the best options based on current information.

2. **Exploration**: The other buttons (yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed yet, so we don’t know their reward distributions. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.

3. **Strategy**: Since we’re early in the 100 time steps (only 3 steps completed), it’s still beneficial to explore. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise. Given that blue and red are tied, we can choose one of them to exploit while keeping exploration in mind for future steps.

Given the current information, the best choice is to **exploit** one of the buttons with the highest observed reward. Since both blue and red have the same average reward, we can choose either. For consistency, let’s choose **blue**.

2. **Exploration**: The buttons that have not been pressed yet (pink, black, white) or have been pressed only once with low rewards (green, yellow, orange) need to be explored to gather more information about their potential rewards.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we have 91 time steps remaining, we can afford to explore some of the unpressed buttons while still exploiting the known good ones. However, given the limited data, it’s prudent to prioritize buttons that have shown promise.

Given this, the best choice is to press the **blue** button again, as it has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to suggest reliability. However, to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better buttons, we should also consider exploring one of the unpressed buttons in the next few steps.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **red**, **purple**, and **brown**, each with an average reward of 1.0. However, these buttons have only been pressed once, so their true reward distributions are still uncertain.

2. **Exploration**: The buttons **pink**, **black**, and **white** have not been pressed at all, so their reward distributions are completely unknown. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.

3. **Balancing Exploitation and Exploration**: Since we are early in the process (only 10 out of 100 time steps), exploration is still valuable. However, we should also consider the buttons that have shown promising results with limited data.

4. **Decision**: Given the high average reward of the **blue** button (0.75 over 4 presses), it is a safer choice for exploitation. However, to maximize potential gains, we should also explore the unpressed buttons. Since **pink**, **black**, and **white** are equally unexplored, we can choose one of them randomly or systematically.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **pink** (average reward: 1.0, pressed 2 times)
   - **brown** (average reward: 1.0, pressed 1 time)
   - **red** (average reward: 0.6667, pressed 3 times)
   - **blue** (average reward: 0.6, pressed 5 times)

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **green**, **yellow**, **orange**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to chance, and they might have higher rewards.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only 18 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room to explore. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise but haven’t been pressed enough to confirm their true potential.

4. **Decision**: 
   - **pink** and **brown** have the highest rewards but have been pressed very few times. **pink** has been pressed twice, so it’s a safer bet than **brown**, which has only been pressed once.
   - **red** and **blue** are also strong candidates, but they’ve been pressed more often, so their rewards are more reliable but less exciting.

5. **Final Choice**: Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, **pink** is the best choice because it has the highest average reward and hasn’t been pressed enough to fully understand its potential.

1. **Identify High-Reward Buttons**:  
   - **Pink** and **Brown** have the highest average rewards (1.0) and have been pressed 4 and 3 times, respectively.  
   - **Red** has a high average reward (0.6667) with only 3 presses.

3. **Balance Exploitation and Exploration**:  
   - Since we’re early in the 100 time steps (only 22 presses so far), exploration is still important to gather more data.  
   - However, exploiting the best-known buttons (Pink and Brown) is also crucial to maximize immediate rewards.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - **Pink** and **Brown** are the top candidates for exploitation, but **Brown** has fewer presses (3 vs. 4 for Pink), so it might be worth pressing **Brown** again to confirm its high reward.  
   - Alternatively, exploring **Green**, **Yellow**, or **Orange** could reveal a better option, but the risk is higher.  

Given the current data, **Brown** is the safest choice for exploitation, as it has a perfect average reward and fewer presses compared to Pink.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between **exploitation** (choosing buttons that have already shown high rewards) and **exploration** (trying buttons with fewer presses to gather more information about their potential rewards).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the best-performing buttons so far:**
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of 0.857 (highest) with 7 presses.
   - **Brown button**: Average reward of 0.75 with 4 presses.
   - **Red button**: Average reward of 0.667 with 3 presses.
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of 0.6 with 5 presses.

2. **Consider exploration:**
   - Buttons like **green, yellow, orange, black, and white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. This could be due to bad luck, so they might still be worth exploring.

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration:**
   - Since we’re only 26 time steps in (out of 100), there’s still room for exploration. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise but haven’t been pressed too many times.
   - The **pink button** has the highest average reward but has been pressed 7 times already. It’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - The **brown button** has a high average reward (0.75) but has only been pressed 4 times, making it a good candidate for further exploitation.
   - Buttons like **green, yellow, orange, black, and white** need more exploration since they’ve only been pressed once.

4. **Decision:**
   - Given the high average reward of the **pink button** and its relatively higher number of presses, it’s a safe choice for exploitation.
   - However, to balance exploration, we should also consider buttons with fewer presses but potential for higher rewards. The **brown button** is a strong contender here.

Given the current data, the **pink button** remains the most promising choice for maximizing immediate reward, but we should keep an eye on the **brown button** for future steps.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **pink** (average reward: 0.7, pressed 10 times)
   - **red** (average reward: 0.6667, pressed 3 times)
   - **blue** and **brown** (both with average reward: 0.6, pressed 5 times each)

2. **Exploration**: Several buttons have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, but this could be due to randomness. These buttons are:
   - **green**
   - **yellow**
   - **orange**
   - **black**
   - **white**

3. **Strategy**: Since we have 70 time steps remaining, we should continue to explore buttons that have been pressed fewer times while also exploiting the buttons with high rewards. However, given the limited data, it’s risky to ignore the buttons with high rewards entirely.

### Decision:
- **Pink** has the highest average reward (0.7) and has been pressed 10 times, so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
- **Red** has a slightly lower average reward (0.6667) but has been pressed only 3 times, so it’s worth exploring further.
- Buttons like **green**, **yellow**, **orange**, **black**, and **white** need more exploration, but their current average reward of 0.0 is unpromising.

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, **pink** is the best choice for now, as it has the highest proven reward.

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Red button**: 0.6667 (pressed 3 times)
   - **Pink button**: 0.6364 (pressed 11 times)
   - **Blue button**: 0.6 (pressed 5 times)
   - **Brown button**: 0.6 (pressed 5 times)

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times or not at all, and their true reward potential is still uncertain:
   - **Green, Yellow, Orange, Black, White**: All pressed only once with 0.0 reward.
   - **Purple**: Pressed twice with 0.5 reward.

3. **Decision**:
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.6667) but has only been pressed 3 times, so it's worth exploiting further.
   - The **pink button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.6364) but has been pressed 11 times, so its reward is more reliable.
   - The **blue and brown buttons** have the same average reward (0.6) but have been pressed 5 times each, making them less uncertain than the red button.
   - The **green, yellow, orange, black, and white buttons** have been pressed only once and have 0.0 reward, so they are high-risk, high-reward choices.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, the **red button** is the best choice because it has the highest average reward so far and has been pressed relatively few times, leaving room for further validation.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button**: Highest average reward (0.6666) with 6 presses. It seems promising but has been pressed relatively often.  
   - **Pink button**: Second-highest average reward (0.5833) with 12 presses. It’s been pressed the most, so its reward distribution is better understood.  
   - **Brown button**: Average reward of 0.6 with 5 presses. It’s a strong contender and less explored than pink.  
   - **Other buttons (green, yellow, orange, black, white)**: All have been pressed only once with zero rewards. They are highly unexplored and could potentially yield higher rewards.  

2. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have 66 time steps remaining, we can afford to explore buttons that have been pressed fewer times while still exploiting the best-known options.  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward so far, but it’s worth exploring buttons like **green, yellow, orange, black, or white** to see if they might offer better rewards.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high uncertainty around the unexplored buttons and the strong performance of the **blue button**, it’s a good balance to press **blue** again to exploit its known reward while keeping in mind to explore other buttons in subsequent steps.

**Pink** and **Brown** have the highest average rewards, but **Brown** has been pressed fewer times compared to **Pink**. This suggests that **Brown** might still have some potential for higher rewards, and it’s worth exploring further.

**Blue** also has a decent average reward but has been pressed more times than **Brown**. 

The buttons **Green**, **Yellow**, **Orange**, **Black**, and **White** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons need more exploration to determine their true potential.

Given the current data, **Brown** seems like a good choice because it has a high average reward and has been pressed fewer times compared to **Pink**. However, to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially higher rewards from less explored buttons, we should also consider exploring one of the buttons that have been pressed only once.

Since **Brown** has shown promising results and has been pressed fewer times than **Pink**, it’s a good candidate for the next press.

   Some buttons (e.g., green, yellow, orange, black, white) have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have low or zero average rewards. However, since we’re aiming to maximize rewards in the remaining time steps, exploring these buttons is less critical unless we have more time left.  

3. **Exploitation strategy**:  
   Given the limited time (58 remaining steps), it’s better to exploit the buttons with the highest known rewards. Among **brown**, **pink**, and **blue**, **brown** has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of presses to validate its performance.

2. **Evaluate exploration needs**:  
   - Buttons like **green**, **yellow**, **orange**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have low or zero average rewards. However, they might still have higher true means, so exploring them slightly could be beneficial.  
   - Buttons like **red** and **purple** have moderate average rewards (0.5) but have been pressed only 4 and 2 times, respectively. They could also be worth exploring further.  

3. **Balance exploration and exploitation**:  
   - Given that we have 57 remaining time steps, we should prioritize exploiting the best-performing buttons while occasionally exploring under-sampled buttons.  
   - The **brown button** has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of presses, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.  

4. **Final decision**:  
   The **brown button** has the highest average reward and is a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **brown** (average reward: 0.7857, pressed 14 times)
   - **blue** (average reward: 0.5714, pressed 7 times)
   - **pink** (average reward: 0.5833, pressed 12 times)

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times and have shown low or zero rewards, but their true potential is still uncertain:
   - **green** (pressed 2 times, average reward: 0.0)
   - **yellow** (pressed 1 time, average reward: 0.0)
   - **orange** (pressed 1 time, average reward: 0.0)
   - **black** (pressed 1 time, average reward: 0.0)
   - **white** (pressed 1 time, average reward: 0.0)

3. **Decision**: Given that we have only 55 time steps left (100 - 45 = 55), we should prioritize exploitation to maximize rewards while still exploring a bit to avoid missing out on potentially better buttons.

   - **brown** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, making it a strong candidate.
   - **pink** and **blue** are also good options but slightly lower in average reward compared to **brown**.

4. **Final Choice**: Since **brown** has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to suggest reliability, it’s the best choice for exploitation.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between **exploiting** the buttons that have shown high rewards so far and **exploring** buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information about their potential rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **brown** (average reward: 0.8, pressed 20 times)
   - **pink** (average reward: 0.5833, pressed 12 times)
   - **blue** (average reward: 0.5714, pressed 7 times)

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times and have shown low or zero rewards, but their true means are still uncertain:
   - **green** (pressed 2 times, average reward 0.0)
   - **yellow** (pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0)
   - **orange** (pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0)
   - **black** (pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0)
   - **white** (pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0)

3. **Decision**: Given that we have 49 time steps remaining, we should prioritize exploiting the buttons with the highest known rewards while still exploring a few under-explored buttons to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better options.

   - **brown** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a reasonable number of times, so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **pink** and **blue** are also good candidates but have slightly lower rewards compared to **brown**.
   - Buttons like **green**, **yellow**, **orange**, **black**, and **white** need more exploration, but given their low rewards so far, they are riskier choices.

4. **Final Choice**: Since **brown** has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be relatively confident in its performance, it’s the best choice for this time step.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the best-performing buttons**:  
   - **Brown** has the highest average reward (0.8095) and has been pressed 21 times, indicating a reliable estimate.  
   - **Pink** has a good average reward (0.5833) and has been pressed 12 times, also a reliable estimate.  
   - **Blue** has a decent average reward (0.5714) but has been pressed only 7 times, so its estimate might still improve.  

2. **Consider under-explored buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **green**, **yellow**, **orange**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have low or zero average rewards. Exploring these could reveal higher rewards, but the risk is high.  

3. **Balance exploration and exploitation**:  
   - Since we have 48 remaining time steps, we can afford to explore a bit more, but the focus should still be on exploiting the best-known options.  
   - **Brown** is the clear leader, but exploring **blue** further could be beneficial given its decent performance and fewer trials.  

4. **Final decision**:  
   - **Brown** is the safest choice for immediate reward maximization.  
   - **Blue** is a good candidate for further exploration to confirm its potential.  

Given the high reward and reliability of **brown**, it’s the best choice for this step.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **brown button** has the highest average reward (0.7857) and has been pressed 28 times, indicating it’s a reliable choice. The **pink button** also has a high average reward (0.5833) and has been pressed 12 times. The **blue button** has a decent average reward (0.5714) but has only been pressed 7 times.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **green**, **yellow**, **orange**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have low or zero average rewards. However, they could potentially have higher rewards that we haven’t discovered yet.

3. **Current Strategy**: Since we’re only 59 time steps in (with 41 remaining), we still have room for exploration. However, given the high reward of the **brown button**, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation to maximize immediate rewards.

4. **Decision**: Given the high average reward of the **brown button** and its reliability, it’s the best choice for this time step to maximize the total reward.

   - Buttons like **green, yellow, orange, black, and white** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have shown low or zero rewards, so they are candidates for exploration.  

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Since we have 40 time steps left, we should focus on exploiting the best-performing buttons while occasionally exploring under-tested buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on higher rewards.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Brown button** is the most reliable choice based on its high average reward and sufficient data.  
   - However, to ensure we’re not overlooking better options, we should occasionally explore buttons like **green, yellow, orange, black, or white**.

   - **Red** and **purple** have moderate rewards (0.5) but fewer presses (4 and 2, respectively).  

3. **Prioritize exploitation vs. exploration**:  
   - Given that we have only 39 time steps left (100 - 61 = 39), we should prioritize buttons with proven higher rewards to maximize total reward.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons that have shown high average rewards so far and exploring other buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information about their potential rewards.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Brown button** has the highest average reward (0.7222) and has been pressed 36 times, indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Pink button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.5833) but has been pressed only 12 times, suggesting it might still have potential.  
   - **Blue button** has a decent average reward (0.5714) but has been pressed only 7 times, so it could be worth exploring further.  
   - Other buttons (green, yellow, orange, black, white) have either low or zero average rewards and have been pressed very few times, making them less attractive for exploitation but still worth exploring.

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Given that we have only 33 time steps left (100 - 67 = 33), we should focus more on exploiting the buttons with the highest known rewards while still allocating some trials to explore buttons with fewer presses.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Brown button** is the most reliable choice for exploitation, given its high average reward and the fact that it has been pressed the most.  
   - However, to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better buttons, we should allocate a few trials to explore buttons like **blue** and **pink**, which have shown promise but have been pressed fewer times.  

Given the remaining time steps and the need to maximize rewards, the **brown button** is the safest and most rewarding choice at this stage.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Brown button** has the highest average reward (0.7179) and has been pressed 39 times, indicating a reliable estimate.  
   - **Pink button** has a high average reward (0.5833) and has been pressed 12 times, suggesting it’s also a good candidate.  
   - **Blue button** has a decent average reward (0.5714) but has only been pressed 7 times, so its estimate might still improve.  
   - Other buttons (green, yellow, orange, black, white) have either low or zero average rewards and have been pressed very few times, indicating they might be worth exploring.

2. **Prioritizing High-Reward Buttons**:  
   - The **brown button** is the clear leader in terms of both average reward and number of presses, making it the safest choice for exploitation.  
   - The **pink button** is a close second and could be a good alternative if we want to diversify slightly.  

3. **Exploration of Under-Pressed Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **green, yellow, orange, black, and white** have been pressed very few times and have low or zero rewards. Exploring these could reveal higher rewards, but it’s riskier.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Given the goal is to maximize total reward, the **brown button** is the most reliable choice due to its high average reward and sufficient number of presses. Exploring other buttons is riskier and less likely to yield a higher total reward in the remaining 30 steps.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 25 time steps, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons with the highest known average rewards and exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to better understand their potential rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **brown** (average reward: 0.7045, pressed 44 times)
   - **blue** (average reward: 0.5714, pressed 7 times)
   - **pink** (average reward: 0.5833, pressed 12 times)

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **green**, **yellow**, **orange**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have an average reward of 0.0. However, their true reward potential is still uncertain due to the small sample size.

3. **Decision**: 
   - **brown** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, making it a safe choice for exploitation.
   - **blue** and **pink** also have decent average rewards but have been pressed fewer times compared to **brown**.
   - Exploring buttons like **green**, **yellow**, **orange**, **black**, or **white** could potentially reveal higher rewards, but the risk is higher due to their low sample size and current average reward of 0.0.

Given the goal is to maximize the total reward, **brown** is the most reliable choice based on current data. However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should allocate a small portion of the remaining steps to exploration.

Since we have 25 steps left, let’s allocate 20 steps to exploitation (focusing on **brown**) and 5 steps to exploration (trying buttons like **green**, **yellow**, **orange**, **black**, or **white**).

For this step, we’ll exploit the **brown** button to maximize immediate reward.

   - Other buttons like **green, yellow, orange, black, and white** have either low or zero average rewards and have been pressed very few times, so they are riskier choices.  

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 24 time steps left (100 - 76 = 24), we should focus more on exploiting the buttons with the highest known rewards while still exploring a few under-pressed buttons with potential.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Brown button** is the safest choice due to its high average reward and consistent performance.  
   - **Blue button** is worth exploring further due to its high average reward and fewer presses.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Brown button** has the highest average reward (0.6739) and has been pressed 46 times, indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Current Strategy**:

3. **Decision**:

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Brown button** has the highest average reward (0.6538) and has been pressed 52 times, indicating it’s a reliable choice.  
   - **Pink button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.5833) but has been pressed only 12 times, suggesting it might still have potential.  
   - **Blue button** has a high average reward (0.5714) but has been pressed only 7 times, so it could be worth exploring further.  
   - Buttons like **green, yellow, orange, black, and white** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have shown low or zero rewards, but they could still be worth exploring.

2. **Remaining Time Steps**:  
   With 17 time steps left, we should focus on buttons that have shown promise but haven’t been fully explored, while still prioritizing the highest average reward buttons.

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Brown button** is the safest choice for exploitation, but we should also explore **blue** and **pink** buttons to confirm their potential.  
   - Given the limited time, exploring buttons with very low or zero rewards (like green, yellow, orange, black, white) is less likely to yield better results than sticking with proven buttons.

**Final Choice**:  
Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, the **brown button** remains the best choice for maximizing immediate reward, but we should also consider **blue** or **pink** for exploration. However, since we’re aiming to maximize total reward, the **brown button** is the most reliable option.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Brown button** has the highest average reward (0.6415) and has been pressed 53 times, indicating it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Blue button** has a high average reward (0.5714) but has only been pressed 7 times, suggesting it might be worth exploring further.  
   - **Pink button** also has a decent average reward (0.5833) and has been pressed 12 times, making it another candidate for exploitation or further exploration.  
   - Buttons like **green, yellow, orange, black, and white** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have low or zero average rewards, indicating they might be worth exploring to see if they have higher potential.

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 16 time steps left (100 - 84 = 16), we should focus more on exploiting the buttons with the highest known rewards while still allocating some trials to explore buttons with fewer presses.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Brown button** is the most reliable choice for exploitation given its high average reward and the remaining time steps.  
   - However, to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better buttons, we should allocate a few trials to **blue** and **pink** buttons, as they have shown promising results with fewer presses.  

Given the remaining time and the need to maximize rewards, the **brown button** is the safest and most rewarding choice at this stage.

1. **Brown Button**:  
   - Average reward: 0.644 (highest among all buttons)  
   - Pressed 59 times (most frequently pressed, so the estimate is relatively reliable)  
   - This is the most promising button based on both the average reward and the number of trials.

2. **Pink Button**:  
   - Average reward: 0.583 (second highest)  
   - Pressed 12 times (moderate number of trials, but fewer than brown)  
   - A good alternative if we want to explore further, but brown is still more reliable.

3. **Blue Button**:  
   - Average reward: 0.571  
   - Pressed 7 times (fewer trials than brown and pink)  
   - Less reliable than brown and pink due to fewer trials.

4. **Other Buttons**:  
   - Green, yellow, orange, black, and white have very low or zero average rewards and have been pressed very few times.  
   - These are not good choices based on current data.

**Conclusion**:

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the average rewards**:  
   - **Brown button**: 0.6333 (highest average reward, pressed 60 times)  
   - **Blue button**: 0.5714 (second-highest average reward, pressed 7 times)  
   - **Pink button**: 0.5833 (third-highest average reward, pressed 12 times)  
   - Other buttons (green, yellow, orange, black, white) have low or zero average rewards and fewer presses, making them less promising.

2. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**:  
   - With only 9 time steps left, the focus should be on **exploitation** (choosing the button with the highest known reward) rather than exploration (testing less-pressed buttons).  
   - The brown button has the highest average reward and a large number of presses, making it the most reliable choice.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The brown button is the best choice to maximize the total reward in the remaining time steps.

   - Buttons like **green**, **yellow**, **orange**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have low or zero average rewards, so they are riskier choices.  

2. **Remaining Time Steps**:

3. **Decision**:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Brown** has the highest average reward (0.6349) and has been pressed the most (63 times), making it a reliable choice.  
   - **Blue** has a slightly lower average reward (0.5714) but has been pressed only 7 times, leaving room for potential improvement.

2. **Buttons with Zero Rewards**:  
   - **Green**, **Yellow**, **Orange**, **Black**, and **White** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons could be worth exploring, but given the limited time steps remaining (6), the risk of not gaining any reward is high.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Brown** is the safest choice due to its high average reward and reliability.  
   - **Blue** and **Pink** are also strong contenders but have slightly lower averages compared to **Brown**.  
   - Exploring buttons with zero rewards is too risky given the limited time.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the buttons with the highest average rewards:**
   - **Brown button:** Average reward of 0.6567 (highest among all buttons).
   - **Blue button:** Average reward of 0.5714 (second highest).
   - **Pink button:** Average reward of 0.5833 (third highest).

2. **Consider the number of times each button has been pressed:**
   - **Brown button:** Pressed 67 times, which is a significant number of trials, making its average reward more reliable.
   - **Blue button:** Pressed 7 times, which is fewer trials, but still a decent sample size.
   - **Pink button:** Pressed 12 times, which is a moderate number of trials.

3. **Evaluate the risk and potential reward:**
   - **Brown button:** Given its high average reward and large number of trials, it is the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.
   - **Blue button:** While it has a slightly lower average reward than brown, it has been pressed fewer times, so there’s a chance its true mean could be higher. However, the brown button’s reliability makes it a safer choice.
   - **Pink button:** It has a good average reward but has been pressed more times than blue, making it less attractive compared to brown.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The **brown button** has the highest average reward and a large number of trials, making it the best choice to maximize the total reward in the remaining 2 time steps.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward, we should focus on the buttons that have shown the highest average rewards so far, while also considering the number of times each button has been pressed to ensure we have a reliable estimate of their performance.

1. **Brown Button**:  
   - Pressed 68 times with an average reward of 0.6617647058823529.  
   - This is the most frequently pressed button and has the highest average reward. It seems to be the most reliable choice.

2. **Pink Button**:  
   - Pressed 12 times with an average reward of 0.5833333333333334.  
   - This is a decent option but has a lower average reward compared to the brown button.

3. **Blue Button**:  
   - Pressed 7 times with an average reward of 0.5714285714285714.  
   - Another decent option but still lower than the brown button.

4. **Other Buttons**:  
   - Green, red, yellow, purple, orange, black, and white buttons have either low average rewards or very few presses, making them less reliable choices.

Given that this is the 100th and final time step, the best strategy is to choose the button with the highest expected reward based on the data we have. The **brown button** has the highest average reward and a large number of presses, making it the most reliable choice.
