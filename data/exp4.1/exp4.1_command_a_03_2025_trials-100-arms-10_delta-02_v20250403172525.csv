A common strategy in such scenarios is to use a **bandit algorithm** like **Epsilon-Greedy**, **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**, or **Thompson Sampling**. However, since we have no data yet, the simplest approach is to start by exploring each button equally.

Given that all buttons have been pressed 0 times, we can arbitrarily choose any button to start. Let's choose the **blue** button as our first choice to begin the exploration process.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Data Analysis**:  
   - **Red button**: Pressed once, average reward = 1.0 (highest so far).  
   - **Blue button**: Pressed once, average reward = 0.0.  
   - All other buttons (green, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed yet, so their rewards are unknown.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - **Exploitation**: The red button has given the highest reward so far, so pressing it again is a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.  
   - **Exploration**: We have 98 time steps left, and we need to learn about the other buttons. However, since we only have data for 2 buttons, it’s still early to explore too much.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given the limited data, the red button is the best choice for now because it has the highest known reward. We can explore other buttons in subsequent steps once we have more information.

   - **Red button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 1.0. This is the highest average reward so far.
   - **Blue button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. This is a neutral result.
   - **Other buttons**: None have been pressed yet, so we have no information about their rewards.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - **Exploitation**: Based on the current data, the red button has the highest average reward. Pressing it again is likely to yield a high reward.
   - **Exploration**: We have not tried the other buttons yet. Some of them might have higher average rewards than the red button, but we won't know unless we try them.

3. **Decision Strategy**:
   - Since we are early in the 100 time steps (only 3 steps completed), it’s still beneficial to explore a bit to gather more information about the other buttons. However, given the high reward from the red button, it’s also reasonable to exploit it to maximize immediate rewards.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - Given the high average reward from the red button and the early stage of the game, it’s a good strategy to press the red button again to continue exploiting its high reward while we still have time to explore other buttons later.

2. **Blue button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0. This button has not shown any reward yet, but it's worth exploring further.

- **Exploration**: We should also explore the untested buttons to discover if any of them might yield higher rewards than the red button.

Given that we have only 5 time steps completed out of 100, it's still early in the game. We should balance exploitation and exploration. Since the red button is performing well, we'll exploit it for now, but we should also start exploring other buttons soon.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Observations**:  
   - The **red button** has been pressed 8 times with an average reward of 0.875, which is the highest observed reward so far.  
   - The **blue** and **green** buttons have been pressed once each, with average rewards of 0.0, but this is based on very limited data.  
   - The remaining buttons (**yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white**) have not been pressed at all, so their potential rewards are completely unknown.

2. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Exploitation**: The red button is the safest choice based on current data, as it has consistently provided high rewards.  
   - **Exploration**: The unexplored buttons could potentially have higher rewards than the red button, but this is uncertain. Since we have 90 time steps left, it’s worth exploring at least some of the untested buttons to gather more information.

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Given that the red button has performed well so far, it’s reasonable to continue exploiting it for now. However, we should also start exploring the untested buttons to avoid missing out on potentially better options.  
   - Since this is only the 11th time step, we can afford to explore one of the untested buttons.

4. **Decision**:  
   - Let’s explore one of the untested buttons to gather more information. A good candidate is the **yellow button**, as it’s the first in the list of untested buttons.

The other buttons (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white) have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**: The red button is the best-performing option so far, but we need to balance exploitation (choosing the best-known option) with exploration (trying other options to gather more data).
2. **Current Data**: The red button has a high average reward, and the other pressed buttons have not yielded any reward.
3. **Strategy**: Given the early stage of the game (only 11 out of 100 steps), it’s reasonable to continue exploiting the red button while planning to explore other buttons in subsequent steps.

The remaining buttons (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white) have not been pressed at all, so their potential rewards are unknown.

To maximize the total reward, we should prioritize the button with the highest known average reward while also considering exploration to gather more information about the other buttons. However, since we only have 100 time steps and have already used 20, it’s crucial to balance exploitation and exploration.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Exploitation:** The red button has the highest average reward so far (0.7647), making it the best choice for maximizing immediate rewards.
2. **Exploration:** The other buttons (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been explored, but given the limited time steps, exploring them now might not yield enough data to confidently switch from the red button.
3. **Risk vs. Reward:** Pressing the red button again is the safest choice to maintain a high average reward, especially since the other buttons with known rewards (blue, green, yellow) have performed poorly.

**Conclusion:** The red button is the best choice at this stage to maximize the total reward.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","Given the current data, the **red button** has been pressed the most (27 times) and has the highest average reward of **0.6296**. This suggests that the red button is the most promising choice so far.

The other buttons (blue, green, yellow) have been pressed only once each and have an average reward of **0.0**, which doesn't provide enough information to make a confident decision about their potential rewards.

The remaining buttons (purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed at all, so we have no data on their rewards. While exploring these buttons could potentially reveal higher rewards, it's a riskier choice given the limited time steps remaining (70 out of 100).

**Strategy:**  
- **Exploitation:** Stick with the red button, as it has the highest known reward.  
- **Exploration:** Consider exploring other buttons sparingly to gather more data, but prioritize exploitation given the limited time.  

Since the red button has the highest known reward and we have limited time, the optimal choice is to press the red button again.

To maximize the total reward, the best strategy is to continue exploiting the button with the highest known reward while also exploring other buttons to gather more information. However, since we only have 100 time steps and have already used 42, it’s crucial to focus on the button with the highest proven reward to maximize gains.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Red button** has the highest average reward (0.5789473684210527) based on 38 trials.
2. Other buttons with data (blue, green, yellow, purple) have no reward yet, and their single trials are not enough to conclude they are better.
3. Unexplored buttons (orange, brown, pink, black, white) are risky since we have no data on their rewards.
4. Given the limited time steps remaining (58), exploiting the **red button** is the safest choice to maximize rewards.

The buttons that have not been pressed yet (orange, brown, pink, black, white) have unknown rewards, but exploring them at this stage might not be optimal since we have a button with a known and relatively high reward.

However, it's also important to explore the other buttons to ensure we don't miss out on potentially higher rewards. Since we have only 49 time steps left, we should balance exploitation (choosing the red button) with exploration (trying other buttons).

Given the high average reward of the red button and the limited exploration so far, the best strategy is to continue exploiting the red button while gradually exploring the untested buttons. For now, the red button remains the best choice based on the current data.

This suggests that the red button is the most promising choice so far.

The other buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple, orange) have been pressed only once each and have an average reward of **0.0**, which doesn't provide enough information to make a confident decision about their potential rewards. The buttons that haven't been pressed at all (brown, pink, black, white) are completely unknown and could have higher or lower rewards, but exploring them at this stage might be risky given the limited time steps remaining.

Since the goal is to maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, it's best to continue exploiting the button with the highest known reward while occasionally exploring other buttons to gather more data. However, with only 39 time steps left and the red button performing well, it's reasonable to stick with it for now.

Since the red button has consistently provided a positive reward and we have limited time, it's optimal to continue exploiting the red button to maximize the total reward. Exploration of other buttons can be considered later if the red button's performance decreases or if we have more time steps left.

However, the other buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple, orange) have only been pressed once each, and their average rewards are all **0.0**. This means we have very little information about their true reward distributions. To maximize total reward, we should balance exploitation (choosing the best-known option) with exploration (trying under-explored options to gather more information).

Since we have only 30 time steps left (out of 100), it’s still worth exploring the under-explored buttons to ensure we’re not missing a better option. However, given the limited time and the strong performance of the red button, we should prioritize exploitation while still exploring a bit.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Red button** is the best-known option with a high average reward.
2. Other buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple, orange) are under-explored and could potentially yield higher rewards.
3. With only 30 time steps left, we should focus on maximizing rewards while still exploring a few under-explored options.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","Given the current data, the **red button** has been pressed the most (66 times) and has the highest average reward of **0.5757575757575758**. The other buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple, orange) have been pressed only once each and have an average reward of **0.0**, which is not informative since they have been sampled so few times. The buttons brown, pink, black, and white have not been pressed at all, so their potential rewards are completely unknown.

To maximize the total reward, the best strategy is to continue exploiting the **red button**, as it has the highest known reward. However, it’s also important to explore the other buttons to gather more information about their potential rewards, especially since we have only 29 time steps left.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration:** The red button is the best-performing option so far, but we should also consider exploring other buttons to avoid missing out on potentially higher rewards.
2. **Remaining Time Steps:** With 29 time steps left, we can afford to explore a few more buttons while still exploiting the red button most of the time.
3. **Prioritize Exploration:** Since the brown, pink, black, and white buttons have not been pressed at all, they are the most uncertain. However, given the limited time, it’s more efficient to explore buttons that have been pressed once (blue, green, yellow, purple, orange) to gather more data.

**Decision:** For this time step, we will **exploit the red button** to maximize immediate reward while planning to explore other buttons in subsequent steps.

This suggests that the red button is the most promising choice so far.

The other buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple, orange) have been pressed only once each and have an average reward of **0.0**, which doesn't provide enough information to make a confident decision about their potential rewards. The buttons that haven't been pressed at all (brown, pink, black, white) are complete unknowns and carry higher uncertainty.

Since the goal is to **maximize the total reward** and we have limited time steps remaining (28 out of 100), it's best to continue exploiting the button with the highest known reward while also exploring other buttons sparingly to gather more data.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**: The red button has the highest average reward and sufficient data, making it the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.
2. **Uncertainty in Other Buttons**: Buttons with zero or one press have unknown potential, but exploring them now might risk lower rewards.
3. **Remaining Time Steps**: With 28 steps left, focusing on the red button while occasionally exploring others is a balanced strategy.

The buttons **brown, pink, black, and white** have not been pressed at all, so their potential rewards are completely unknown.

Since our goal is to maximize the total reward over the remaining 16 time steps, we should prioritize buttons that have shown a higher average reward so far. However, exploring the untested buttons could potentially reveal a higher reward distribution.

**Strategy:**
1. **Exploitation:** Continue pressing the **red button** since it has the highest known average reward.
2. **Exploration:** Allocate a few trials to explore the untested buttons (brown, pink, black, white) to gather more information about their reward distributions.

Given that we have only 16 time steps left, it's risky to spend too much time exploring untested buttons, as the red button has already proven to be a reliable choice. Therefore, we will primarily exploit the red button while reserving a small number of trials for exploration.

**Next Choice:**
Since the red button has the highest known reward and we have limited time left, we will press it again to maximize our expected reward.

The other buttons (blue, green, yellow, purple, orange) have been pressed only once each and have an average reward of **0.0**, which is not informative since they have been pressed so few times. The buttons brown, pink, black, and white have not been pressed at all, so their potential rewards are completely unknown.

Since our goal is to maximize the total reward, the **red button** is the safest and most rewarding choice based on the available data. However, to explore and potentially find a better option, we should also consider pressing one of the unexplored buttons (brown, pink, black, or white) to gather more information.

Given that we have only 8 time steps left, it’s risky to explore buttons with unknown rewards, as we might miss out on the higher expected reward from the red button. Therefore, the optimal choice is to stick with the **red button** for now.

Since the goal is to maximize the total reward over the remaining 5 time steps, the **red button** is the most reliable choice based on the available data. However, it's also important to consider the potential for higher rewards from unexplored buttons, as they could have higher means. Given the limited time left (5 steps), exploring untested buttons might not yield enough information to outweigh the known reward of the red button.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Red button** has the highest known average reward (0.6) and has been tested extensively.
2. Other tested buttons have lower or zero average rewards.
3. Untested buttons (brown, pink, black, white) are unknown but could have higher rewards.
4. With only 5 steps left, exploiting the known reward of the red button is safer than exploring untested buttons.
