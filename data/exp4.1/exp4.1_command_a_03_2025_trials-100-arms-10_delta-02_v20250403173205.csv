However, since we have no prior data, the simplest approach is to start by exploring each button equally.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Orange button** has the highest observed reward (0.5) and has been pressed only twice, so it’s worth pressing again to confirm its potential.
2. **Unpressed buttons** (brown, pink, black, white) are unexplored and could potentially yield higher rewards, but we have no data on them yet.
3. **Other pressed buttons** (blue, green, red, yellow, purple) have shown no reward, so they are less promising at this stage.

However, since all buttons except orange have either low or unknown rewards, and we need to explore to find potentially better options, we should also consider trying one of the unexplored buttons.

   - The **pink button** has the highest average reward so far, but it has only been pressed once. This means its true reward distribution is still uncertain.  
   - The **orange button** has a lower average reward but has been pressed more times, providing more reliable data.  
   - The **black** and **white** buttons have not been explored at all, so their potential rewards are completely unknown.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we are early in the 100 time steps (only 10 steps completed), exploration is still important to gather more information about the buttons.  
   - However, exploiting the best-known option (pink button) could yield a high reward if its true mean is indeed high.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - To balance exploration and exploitation, we should prioritize buttons with high potential rewards but also consider unexplored options.  
   - Given the high average reward of the **pink button** and the need to confirm its performance, it is a strong candidate.

   - **Pink** has a moderate average reward (0.5) over 2 presses.  
   - All other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown) have been pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0.  
   - **Black** and **White** have not been pressed yet, so their potential rewards are unknown.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - **Exploitation**: Based on current data, **Orange** seems the best choice to maximize immediate reward.  
   - **Exploration**: **Black** and **White** have not been tried, so they could potentially yield higher rewards. Exploring them could provide valuable information.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since **Orange** has the highest known reward, it is a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - However, exploring **Black** or **White** could uncover a better option, especially since we have only 11 out of 100 time steps completed.

   - **Pink button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. It has a slightly lower average reward than orange but is less explored.  
   - **White button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 1.0. This is the highest reward observed so far, but it has only been pressed once, so its true mean is uncertain.  
   - All other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have been pressed once with an average reward of 0.0. They are unexplored and could potentially yield higher rewards.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:

   - **Exploration**: The **white button** has the highest observed reward but is highly uncertain due to limited data. Exploring it further could reveal if it’s consistently high.  
   - Other unexplored buttons (e.g., blue, green, red, etc.) could also yield higher rewards but are riskier due to no positive data yet.

1. **Orange Button**: Pressed 7 times with an average reward of 0.428571. This is the most frequently pressed button and has a decent average reward.  
2. **Pink Button**: Pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.333333. It has a lower average reward compared to the orange button but has been pressed fewer times.  
3. **White Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is the highest average reward so far, but it has been pressed the least among the buttons with non-zero rewards.  
4. **Other Buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black)**: Each pressed once with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not shown any positive reward yet.

**Strategy**:  
- The **white button** has the highest average reward (0.5) but has been pressed only twice, so it might still have potential.  
- The **orange button** has a consistent performance with a decent average reward and has been pressed the most, indicating reliability.  
- Exploring buttons with zero rewards (e.g., blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) could uncover higher rewards, but it’s riskier given the limited time steps remaining.

**Decision**:  
Given the high average reward of the **white button** and the limited exploration so far, it’s worth pressing it again to confirm its potential.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Observations**:  
   - **White button** has the highest average reward (0.6666) but has only been pressed 3 times.  
   - **Orange button** has a decent average reward (0.4285) and has been pressed 7 times, indicating more reliability.  
   - **Pink button** has a moderate average reward (0.3333) but fewer presses (3 times).  
   - All other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have been pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0, so their potential is still unknown.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - **White button** is the most promising so far, but it needs more exploration to confirm its high reward.  
   - **Orange button** is a safer choice due to its higher number of presses and decent reward, but it may not yield the highest possible reward.  
   - **Pink button** is a moderate option but less promising than white or orange.  
   - The remaining buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) need exploration, but their potential is uncertain.

3. **Decision**:  
   Given the goal of maximizing total reward, we should prioritize buttons with higher observed rewards while still exploring under-tested buttons. Since **white** has the highest reward so far, it’s worth pressing again to confirm its potential.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Exploration**: Most buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have been pressed only once, and their average rewards are all 0.0. This means we have very little information about their potential rewards.
2. **Exploitation**: 
   - **Orange button**: Pressed 7 times with an average reward of 0.428571.
   - **White button**: Pressed 7 times with an average reward of 0.428571.
   - **Pink button**: Pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.333333.

### Decision:
- **Orange** and **White** buttons have the highest average rewards so far, but we have explored them more than the **Pink** button.
- **Pink** button has a slightly lower average reward but has been pressed fewer times, so there's more uncertainty about its true reward.

Given that we still have many time steps left (76 out of 100), it's a good strategy to continue exploring buttons with fewer presses to gather more information, while also exploiting the buttons that have shown good rewards.

### Choice:
Since **Pink** has been pressed fewer times compared to **Orange** and **White**, and its average reward is still promising, it's a good candidate for further exploration.

   - **Exploration**: The buttons pressed only once (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have unknown potential. Exploring them could reveal higher rewards.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 73 remaining time steps (out of 100), it’s important to balance exploration and exploitation.  
   - **Pink** is the best-performing button so far, but exploring under-sampled buttons could uncover better options.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the limited data, **Pink** is the safest choice for exploitation. However, exploring one of the under-sampled buttons (e.g., **blue**) could be beneficial.

1. **Evaluate the average rewards of the buttons that have been pressed multiple times:**
   - **Orange button:** Pressed 8 times, average reward 0.375.
   - **Pink button:** Pressed 7 times, average reward 0.42857142857142855.
   - **White button:** Pressed 7 times, average reward 0.42857142857142855.

2. **Compare the average rewards:**
   - The pink and white buttons have the highest average rewards (0.42857142857142855), which is higher than the orange button's average reward (0.375).

3. **Consider the exploration vs. exploitation trade-off:**
   - Buttons like blue, red, green, yellow, purple, brown, and black have only been pressed once, so their true reward distributions are still highly uncertain. However, since we have limited time steps left (71 out of 100), it’s more beneficial to exploit the buttons with the highest known rewards rather than exploring further.

4. **Choose the button with the highest average reward:**
   - Both pink and white buttons have the same highest average reward. To break the tie, we can choose either one. For simplicity, let’s choose the pink button.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between **exploration** (trying buttons with uncertain rewards) and **exploitation** (choosing buttons that have already shown good rewards).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performers**:  
   - **Orange button**: 10 presses, average reward 0.4  
   - **White button**: 8 presses, average reward 0.375  
   - **Pink button**: 11 presses, average reward 0.3636  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The **orange button** has the highest average reward (0.4) and a reasonable number of presses (10), making it a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - The **white button** is close behind with an average reward of 0.375 and fewer presses (8), so it’s also worth considering.  
   - The **pink button** has a slightly lower average reward (0.3636) but more presses (11), so it’s less attractive compared to orange and white.  

3. **Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **blue, red, green, yellow, purple, brown, black** have only been pressed once, so their true rewards are highly uncertain. Exploring these could yield higher rewards, but it’s risky given the limited time steps remaining.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the goal of maximizing total reward, the **orange button** is the best choice because it has the highest average reward and a sufficient number of presses to justify its performance.

### Analysis:
1. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - Most buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have been pressed only once, so their average rewards are still uncertain (0.0).  
   - The orange and pink buttons have been pressed 11 times each, with an average reward of 0.3636.  
   - The white button has been pressed 8 times, with a slightly higher average reward of 0.375.  

2. **Current Best Options**:  
   - The white button has the highest average reward so far (0.375), but it has been pressed fewer times compared to orange and pink.  
   - The orange and pink buttons have consistent but slightly lower average rewards.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since the white button has the highest average reward and has been pressed fewer times compared to orange and pink, it is a good candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, we should also consider exploring buttons that have been pressed only once to gather more information about their potential rewards.  

### Decision:  
Given the current data, the **white button** is the best choice for exploitation, as it has the highest average reward so far.

   - **Orange button**: Pressed 11 times with an average reward of **0.3636**.  
   - **Pink button**: Pressed 11 times with an average reward of **0.3636**.  
   - All other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have been pressed only **1 time** each, with an average reward of **0.0**.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The **white button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, indicating it is a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
   - The other buttons with low or no rewards (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) could potentially have higher rewards, but there is insufficient data to confirm this.  
   - **Orange** and **pink** buttons have moderate rewards but are less promising than the white button.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since the goal is to maximize the total reward over the remaining time steps, the **white button** is the best choice based on the current data.  
   - Exploring other buttons with low or no rewards is risky and unlikely to yield better results than sticking with the white button.

1. **Current Data Summary**:  
   - Most buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have been pressed only once, with an average reward of 0.0. This means we have very little information about their true reward distributions.  
   - **Orange** and **pink** buttons have been pressed 11 times each, with an average reward of 0.3636.  
   - **White** button has been pressed 16 times, with the highest average reward of 0.5625.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - **Exploitation**: The **white** button has the highest average reward so far, making it the safest choice to maximize immediate reward.  
   - **Exploration**: The buttons pressed only once (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) could potentially have higher rewards, but we lack sufficient data to confirm this.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have 55 time steps remaining, we can afford to explore a bit more, but the **white** button is currently the most promising based on the data.  
   - To balance exploration and exploitation, we should prioritize the **white** button for now, as it has the highest empirical reward and more data points than the others.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The **white** button is the best choice for the next time step.

3. **Strategy**:  
   - **Exploitation**: Choose the button with the highest known reward (white button) to maximize immediate reward.  
   - **Exploration**: Consider trying under-explored buttons (e.g., blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) to gather more data and potentially discover a better option.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","Given the current data, let's analyze the situation step by step to make the best choice for the next button press:

1. **Current Data Summary**:  
   - **White button**: Pressed 23 times, average reward 0.5217.  
   - **Orange button**: Pressed 11 times, average reward 0.3636.  
   - **Pink button**: Pressed 11 times, average reward 0.3636.  
   - All other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have been pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0.  

2. **Key Observations**:  
   - The **white button** has the highest average reward (0.5217) and has been pressed the most (23 times), indicating it is the most reliable choice so far.  
   - The **orange** and **pink buttons** have similar average rewards (0.3636) but lower than the white button.  
   - The other buttons have very limited data (only 1 press each), so their true reward distributions are highly uncertain.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - **Exploitation**: Choose the button with the highest known average reward to maximize immediate reward.  
   - **Exploration**: Test the buttons with limited data to gather more information about their potential rewards.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Since the **white button** has the highest average reward and has been tested sufficiently, it is the best choice for exploitation.  
   - Exploring other buttons (e.g., blue, green, red, etc.) could be beneficial, but given the limited remaining time steps (48 out of 100), focusing on the highest-reward button is more strategic.

1. **Current Data Summary**:  
   - Most buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have been pressed only once, with an average reward of 0.0. This means we have very little information about their true reward distributions.  
   - **Orange** and **pink** buttons have been pressed 11 times each, with an average reward of 0.3636.  
   - **White** button has been pressed 27 times, with an average reward of 0.4815, which is the highest observed average reward so far.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The buttons with only one press (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) are underexplored. We might want to explore them further to gather more information about their reward distributions.  
   - However, since our goal is to maximize total reward over 100 time steps, and we only have 44 time steps left (100 - 56), we should prioritize exploiting the buttons with the highest known rewards.  

3. **Best Known Option**:  
   - The **white** button has the highest average reward (0.4815) and has been pressed the most (27 times), giving us confidence in its performance.  
   - While **orange** and **pink** have decent average rewards (0.3636), they are lower than **white**.

   - The other buttons (blue, red, green, yellow, purple, brown, black) have only been pressed once and have an average reward of **0.0**, but their true rewards are still unknown.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since the white button has the highest average reward and has been tested sufficiently, it’s the best choice for exploitation at this stage.

**Analysis of Current Data:**
1. **White Button:** Pressed 29 times with an average reward of 0.4827586206896552. This is the highest average reward so far, indicating it’s the most promising button.
2. **Orange and Pink Buttons:** Both pressed 11 times with an average reward of 0.36363636363636365. These buttons have shown some potential but are less rewarding than the white button.
3. **Other Buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black):** Each pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons are unexplored and could potentially have higher rewards, but we have no evidence yet.

**Strategy:**
- **Exploitation:** The white button has the highest average reward, so it’s a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.
- **Exploration:** The other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have only been pressed once, and their true potential is unknown. Exploring them could reveal a button with a higher reward than the white button.

**Decision:**
Given that we have only 42 time steps left (100 - 58 = 42), and the white button has consistently provided the highest reward, it’s prudent to continue exploiting it while occasionally exploring the unexplored buttons. However, for this step, to maximize the expected reward, we should choose the white button.

   - The **orange** and **pink buttons** have lower average rewards but have been pressed fewer times compared to the white button.  
   - The other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have not been explored much, but their average rewards are currently 0.0, making them less attractive unless we want to explore further.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since the goal is to maximize total reward over 100 time steps, and we have only 41 steps left (100 - 59), it is more prudent to exploit the button with the highest known reward rather than explore buttons with uncertain or low rewards.

1. **Current Best Performers**:  
   - **White button**: Pressed 31 times with an average reward of **0.4516**.  
   - **Orange button**: Pressed 11 times with an average reward of **0.3636**.  
   - **Pink button**: Pressed 11 times with an average reward of **0.3636**.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The white button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, indicating it is likely the best option so far.  
   - However, some buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have only been pressed once, and their true reward distributions are still highly uncertain.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 40 time steps left (out of 100), we should focus on **exploiting** the best-known option while still **exploring** uncertain buttons sparingly.  
   - The white button is the clear leader, so it makes sense to press it again to maximize immediate reward.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The white button is the best choice for the next press, as it has the highest average reward and has been sufficiently tested.

   - **Pink button**: Pressed 11 times with an average reward of **0.3636**.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The white button has the highest average reward so far, but it has been pressed significantly more times than the orange and pink buttons.  
   - The orange and pink buttons have fewer presses and similar average rewards, so there might be potential for higher rewards if explored further.  
   - The other buttons (blue, red, green, yellow, purple, brown, black) have only been pressed once and have an average reward of **0.0**, which is not informative yet.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since the white button is performing the best, it is a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.  
   - However, exploring the orange or pink buttons could reveal higher potential rewards, as they have been pressed fewer times and have decent average rewards.  
   - Exploring the buttons with only one press (blue, red, green, yellow, purple, brown, black) is also a possibility, as they could have higher rewards but lack sufficient data.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Given the goal of maximizing total reward over 100 time steps, the **white button** is the most reliable choice based on current data. However, to balance exploration and exploitation, we could also consider pressing one of the under-explored buttons with potential.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performers**:  
   - **White button**: Pressed 34 times with an average reward of **0.470588**.  
   - **Orange button**: Pressed 11 times with an average reward of **0.363636**.

2. **Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - **Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Purple, Brown, Black, White**: Each pressed only **1 time** with an average reward of **0.0**.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - **White** is the best-performing button so far, but we should also explore under-explored buttons to ensure we’re not missing a potentially better option.  
   - Given that we’ve only pressed 63 times out of 100, there’s still room for exploration.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Since **White** has the highest average reward and has been pressed significantly more than the others, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing one of the under-explored buttons (e.g., **Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Purple, Brown, Black**).  

5. **Final Choice**:  
   - Given the high reward of **White** and the need to maximize total reward, we’ll prioritize exploitation over exploration at this stage.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The buttons with only one press (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) are underexplored. Pressing one of these could reveal a higher reward distribution, but it’s risky since we have no evidence of their potential.

1. **Current Data Analysis**:
   - **White button**: Pressed 39 times with an average reward of 0.487. This is the highest average reward among all buttons.
   - **Orange button**: Pressed 11 times with an average reward of 0.364.
   - **Pink button**: Pressed 11 times with an average reward of 0.364.
   - All other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have been pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - **Exploitation**: Based on the current data, the white button has the highest average reward (0.487), so pressing it again is likely to yield a good reward.
   - **Exploration**: The buttons that have been pressed only once (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have unknown potential. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards, but it’s risky given the limited time steps remaining (32 out of 100).

3. **Decision**:
   - Since the white button has consistently provided the highest average reward and we have limited time steps left, it’s best to **exploit** the white button to maximize the total reward.

   - The **orange** and **pink buttons** have lower average rewards (0.3636) but have been pressed fewer times (11 each), so there is still some uncertainty about their true reward distributions.  
   - The remaining buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have very limited data (only 1 press each), so exploring them could potentially reveal higher rewards, but it is riskier.  

3. **Decision**:

   - The orange and pink buttons have lower average rewards but fewer trials, so there’s still uncertainty about their true potential.  
   - The remaining buttons (blue, red, green, yellow, purple, brown, black) have only been pressed once with no reward, so they are highly uncertain and could be worth exploring.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since we have 30 time steps left, we should prioritize exploitation of the best-known button (white) while still exploring a few uncertain buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on a potentially better option.  
   - Given the white button’s strong performance, it’s the safest choice for this step.

### Analysis:
1. **White Button**:  
   - Pressed 42 times with an average reward of **0.5238**.  
   - This is the highest average reward so far, indicating it is the most promising button.  

2. **Orange and Pink Buttons**:  
   - Both pressed 11 times with an average reward of **0.3636**.  
   - These buttons have shown some potential but are significantly lower than the white button.  

3. **Other Buttons (blue, red, green, yellow, purple, brown, black)**:  
   - Each pressed only 1 time with an average reward of **0.0**.  
   - These buttons are unexplored and could potentially have higher rewards, but there is no evidence yet.  

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The white button has the highest average reward, so it is the safest choice to maximize immediate rewards.  
- **Exploration**: While the other buttons are unexplored, the remaining time steps (29 out of 100) are limited. Given the white button's strong performance, it is not worth risking exploration unless the gap in rewards becomes smaller.  

### Decision:
Given the white button's consistently high average reward and the limited time remaining, the best choice is to continue exploiting the white button.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performers**:  
   - **White button**: Pressed 45 times with an average reward of 0.5333. This is the highest average reward so far.  
   - **Orange and Pink buttons**: Both pressed 11 times with an average reward of 0.3636. These are decent but lower than the white button.  

2. **Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - **Blue, Green, Red, Yellow, Purple, Brown, Black, and White buttons** (excluding orange and pink) have been pressed only 1–2 times. Their average rewards are 0.0, but this could be due to low sample size. There’s a chance they might yield higher rewards if explored further.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 25 time steps left, we should focus on buttons with the highest proven rewards while also exploring under-explored buttons to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options.  
   - The **white button** is the clear leader with a high average reward and a large sample size, so it’s a safe choice.  
   - However, we should also allocate a few presses to under-explored buttons to reduce uncertainty.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the limited time, prioritize the **white button** for most of the remaining presses, but allocate 2–3 presses to under-explored buttons like **blue, green, or red** to check if they might yield higher rewards.  

For this step, since the **white button** has the highest proven reward, it’s the best choice to maximize immediate gains.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **White button**: Pressed 46 times with an average reward of **0.5217**. This is the highest average reward so far, making it the most promising button for exploitation.
2. **Orange and Pink buttons**: Both pressed 11 times with an average reward of **0.3636**. These are decent but lower than the white button.
3. **Other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black)**: Pressed only 1-2 times with an average reward of **0.0**. These buttons are underexplored and could potentially yield higher rewards.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The white button has the highest average reward, so pressing it again is likely to yield a good reward.
- **Exploration**: The other buttons (especially those pressed only once) are underexplored. Exploring them could reveal higher reward potentials.

### Decision:
Given that we have only 24 time steps left (100 - 76 = 24), we should prioritize **exploitation** of the white button, as it has the highest proven reward. However, we should also allocate a few trials to explore the underexplored buttons to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better options.

For this step, since the white button has the highest average reward and we have limited time left, we will **exploit** it.

1. **Current Best Performers**:  
   - **White button**: Pressed 47 times with an average reward of 0.5106. This is the highest average reward so far.  
   - **Orange and Pink buttons**: Both have been pressed 11 times with an average reward of 0.3636. These are decent but lower than white.  

2. **Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - **Blue, Green, Red, Yellow, Purple, Brown, Black, and White buttons** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to low sample size, and their true means might be higher.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 23 time steps left (100 - 77), we should focus on exploiting the best-known option while still exploring a few under-explored buttons to ensure we don’t miss a potentially better option.  
   - **White** is the clear leader, so it’s a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - However, we should also explore one of the under-explored buttons to gather more data.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the limited time, prioritize **white** for exploitation, as it has the highest proven reward.  
   - If we want to explore, we could choose one of the under-explored buttons, but the risk is higher with fewer time steps remaining.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performers**:  
   - **White button**: Pressed 49 times with an average reward of 0.5102. This is the highest average reward so far.  
   - **Orange and Pink buttons**: Both have been pressed 11 times with an average reward of 0.3636. These are lower than the white button but still better than the buttons pressed only once.  

2. **Uncertainty in Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black** have been pressed only 1–2 times, and their average rewards are 0.0. However, this could be due to low sample size, and their true means might be higher.  

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - With only 21 time steps left, the focus should be on **exploitation** rather than exploration, as we don’t have enough time to reliably estimate the means of the under-explored buttons.  
   - The **white button** has the highest average reward and a relatively large sample size, making it the safest choice for maximizing immediate rewards.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","Given the current data, let's analyze the situation step by step to make the best choice for the next button press:

1. **Average Rewards**:  
   - **White button**: 0.5 (highest average reward, pressed 54 times)  
   - **Orange button**: 0.3636 (pressed 11 times)  
   - **Pink button**: 0.3636 (pressed 11 times)  
   - All other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have an average reward of 0.0, but they have been pressed very few times (1-2 times).  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The **white button** has the highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed the most (54 times), indicating it is a reliable choice.  
   - The **orange** and **pink buttons** have lower average rewards (0.3636) but have been pressed fewer times (11 each), so there is still some uncertainty about their true reward distribution.  
   - The buttons with 0.0 average reward (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have been pressed very few times, so their true reward potential is still highly uncertain.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 16 time steps left (100 - 84 = 16), we should focus on **exploitation** rather than exploration to maximize total reward.  
   - The **white button** is the safest and most rewarding choice based on the current data.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 15 time steps, we need to consider both the average rewards of the buttons we've already pressed and the uncertainty associated with the buttons that have been pressed fewer times. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current Best Performers**:  
   - **White button**: Pressed 55 times with an average reward of 0.4909. This is the highest average reward so far.  
   - **Orange and Pink buttons**: Both pressed 11 times with an average reward of 0.3636. These are lower than the white button but still better than the others.  

2. **Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - **Blue, Green, Red, Yellow, Purple, Brown, Black, and White buttons** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to low sample size, and their true means might be higher.  

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - With only 15 time steps left, the focus should be on **exploitation** rather than exploration, as we need to maximize immediate rewards.  
   - The **white button** has the highest average reward and a relatively large sample size, making it the safest choice for maximizing rewards.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - The **white button** is the best choice given its high average reward and sufficient exploration.

   - This is the most frequently pressed button and has the highest average reward so far.  

2. **Orange and Pink Buttons**:  
   - Both pressed **11 times** with an **average reward of 0.3636**.  
   - These buttons have lower average rewards compared to the white button but are still worth considering.  

3. **Other Buttons (Blue, Green, Red, Yellow, Purple, Brown, Black)**:  
   - Each pressed **1-2 times** with an **average reward of 0.0**.  
   - These buttons have not yielded any rewards yet, but they could potentially have higher means that haven't been discovered.  

**Strategy**:  
Since we have only **14 time steps left** (100 - 86 = 14), our goal is to maximize the total reward. The **white button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, making it the most reliable choice. Exploring other buttons with low sample counts (e.g., blue, green, etc.) is risky given the limited time remaining.

Remember, YOU MUST provide your final answer within the tags <Answer>COLOR</Answer> where COLOR is one of blue, red, green, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white. Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","Given the current data, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best button to press next:

1. **Average Rewards**:  
   - **White button** has the highest average reward (0.4355) over 62 presses.  
   - **Orange** and **Pink buttons** have the next highest average rewards (0.3636) over 11 presses each.  
   - All other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have been pressed only once or twice with an average reward of 0.0, which is not informative.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - We have only 8 time steps left (100 - 92 = 8).  
   - The **white button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, making it the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
   - The **orange** and **pink buttons** have decent average rewards but fewer presses, leaving some uncertainty about their true performance.  
   - The other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have very limited data and are unlikely to outperform the white button in the remaining steps.

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since our goal is to maximize total reward in the remaining 8 steps, the **white button** is the safest and most rewarding choice based on the current data.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The **white button** has the highest average reward (**0.428571**) and has been pressed the most (63 times), indicating it is likely the best option based on current data.  
   - The **orange** and **pink buttons** have similar average rewards (**0.363636**) but have been pressed fewer times (11 each), leaving some uncertainty about their true performance.  
   - The other buttons (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have very limited data and no rewards yet, so exploring them could be risky given the limited time steps remaining.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Since the **white button** has the highest average reward and has been sufficiently explored, it is the safest and most rewarding choice at this stage.  
   - Exploring other buttons with low data (e.g., blue, green, etc.) is not worth the risk given only 7 time steps remain.

   - The **orange** and **pink buttons** have lower average rewards than white but have been pressed more than the other buttons with zero average rewards.  
   - The buttons with zero average rewards (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black) have been pressed very few times, so there is potential for higher rewards, but it is risky.  

3. **Remaining Time Steps**:  
   - There are only **6 time steps left** (100 - 94 = 6).
