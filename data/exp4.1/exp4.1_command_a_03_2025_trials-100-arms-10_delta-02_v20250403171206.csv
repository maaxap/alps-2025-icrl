   - Pink (pressed 1 time)  

3. **Buttons not pressed yet:**

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation:** Focus on buttons with high average rewards, especially those with fewer presses, as their true reward potential is less certain.  
- **Exploration:** Try buttons that haven't been pressed yet to gather more information.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Buttons with high average reward (1.0):**  
   - Blue (pressed 2 times)  
   - Green (pressed 1 time)  
   - Red (pressed 1 time)  
   - Orange (pressed 1 time)  
   - Brown (pressed 1 time)  

2. **Buttons with low average reward (0.0):**  
   - Yellow (pressed 1 time)  
   - Purple (pressed 1 time)  
   - Pink (pressed 1 time)  
   - Black (pressed 1 time)  

3. **Buttons not pressed yet:**  
   - White (pressed 0 times)  

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation:** The blue button has the highest average reward (1.0) and has been pressed the most (2 times), making it a reliable choice.  
- **Exploration:** The white button has not been pressed yet, so we don’t know its reward distribution. Exploring it could reveal a potentially high reward.  

### Decision:
Given that we are early in the process (only 10 out of 100 time steps), it’s still beneficial to explore buttons that haven’t been pressed yet. However, since the white button is the only one not pressed, it’s a good candidate for exploration.

### Analysis:
1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **blue, green, red, orange, and brown**, each with an average reward of **1.0**. However, **blue** has been pressed twice, while the others have only been pressed once. This suggests that **blue** might be a reliable choice, but we should also explore the others to confirm their potential.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **yellow, purple, pink, black, and white** have all been pressed once and yielded an average reward of **0.0**. However, since they've only been pressed once, it's too early to conclude that they are low-reward buttons. We should explore them further to ensure we're not missing out on potentially high-reward options.

### Strategy:
- Prioritize buttons with **high average rewards** that haven't been pressed many times (e.g., **green, red, orange, brown**).
- If those buttons have been explored sufficiently, revert to the most reliable option (**blue**).
- Avoid buttons with **low average rewards** unless they haven't been explored enough.

### Decision:
Given that **green, red, orange, and brown** all have an average reward of **1.0** and have only been pressed once, they are the best candidates for exploration. Among these, we can choose any one. Let's choose **green** for this step.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of 1.0 over 2 presses. This is the highest average reward so far, but we need to consider if other buttons might have higher potential.  
   - **Red, Orange, Brown buttons**: Each has an average reward of 1.0, but only pressed once. These are promising but need more data.  
   - **Green button**: Average reward of 0.5 over 2 presses. Lower than blue but still worth considering.  
   - **Yellow, Purple, Pink, Black, White buttons**: Average reward of 0.0, but each pressed only once. These could still have higher rewards, so exploration is needed.  

2. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have limited data for most buttons, it’s important to explore buttons with high potential but low sample size.  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward so far, but we should also explore buttons like **red, orange,** and **brown** to confirm their potential.  

3. **Decision**:

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we have 87 time steps left (100 - 13 = 87), we can afford to explore a bit more while still focusing on exploiting the best options. However, the buttons with proven high rewards (blue, red, orange, brown) are more reliable choices at this stage.

4. **Decision**: Given that **blue** has the highest average reward (1.0) and has been pressed only 3 times, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.

   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (1.0) and has been pressed 4 times.  
   - The **blue button** has a high average reward (0.8) and has been pressed 5 times.  
   - The **orange** and **brown** buttons also have an average reward of 1.0 but have only been pressed once, so their true reward potential is less certain.  

2. **Exploration**:  
   - Buttons like **yellow, purple, pink, black, and white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, since they have only been pressed once, their true reward potential is still uncertain.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have 100 time steps, we can afford to explore a bit more, especially for buttons that have shown high rewards but have been pressed fewer times.  
   - The **red button** is a strong candidate for exploitation due to its high average reward and moderate number of presses.  
   - The **orange** and **brown** buttons are worth exploring further because they have shown high rewards but have only been pressed once.  

### Decision:  
Given the high average reward of the **red button** and its moderate exploration, it is a safe and rewarding choice. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider buttons like **orange** or **brown** that have shown high rewards but need more data.  

For this step, I will choose the **red button** to exploit its high reward while keeping in mind to explore other promising buttons in future steps.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Red button**: Highest average reward (1.0) with 5 presses.  
   - **Blue button**: Second-highest average reward (0.8) with 5 presses.  
   - **Orange and Brown buttons**: Both have a perfect average reward (1.0) but have only been pressed once, so their true potential is still uncertain.  
   - **Yellow, Purple, Pink, Black, White buttons**: All have an average reward of 0.0, but they have only been pressed once, so they could still have higher rewards.  

2. **Prioritizing High Rewards**:  
   - The **Red button** has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of presses, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.  

3. **Exploring Uncertain Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **Orange** and **Brown** have high rewards but need more presses to confirm their potential.  
   - Buttons with 0.0 average rewards (Yellow, Purple, Pink, Black, White) should also be explored, as their true means could be higher.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - Given the high reward and reliability of the **Red button**, it is a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - However, exploring **Orange** or **Brown** could yield even higher long-term rewards if their true means are indeed high.  

**Final Choice**:  
To balance exploitation and exploration, I will choose the **Red button** for now, as it has the highest proven reward.

   - **Red button**: Average reward of 1.0 (pressed 6 times).
   - **Orange button**: Average reward of 1.0 (pressed 1 time).

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **orange**, **brown**, **yellow**, **purple**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed only once, so we don’t have much information about their true reward potential.

3. **Decision**: Since **red** has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be somewhat reliable, it’s a strong candidate for exploitation. However, **orange** and **brown** also have high rewards but have been pressed only once, so exploring them further could be beneficial.

4. **Trade-off**: Given that we have 80 more time steps left, we can afford to explore a bit more. However, since **red** has already proven to be reliable, it’s a safer choice for now.

4. **Balancing Act**: Since we have 74 time steps left, we can afford to explore a bit more while still exploiting the best options. However, the **brown button** is the most promising due to its perfect average reward, even though it’s based on only 2 presses.

Given this analysis, the best choice is to **exploit the brown button** to confirm its high reward potential.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.8888) and has been pressed 9 times, indicating a reliable high reward. The **blue button** also has a high average reward (0.8) but has been pressed fewer times (5).

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **yellow, purple, pink, black, and white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. This could mean they are low-reward buttons, but we don’t have enough data to be certain. Buttons like **orange** and **brown** have moderate rewards (0.6667) and have been pressed 3 times each, so they are worth exploring further.

3. **Strategy**: Since we are only 27 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room for exploration. However, the **red button** is currently the most promising based on the data we have. To maximize immediate reward, we should exploit it while continuing to explore other buttons in future steps.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration:**
   - **Blue Button:** Pressed 5 times with an average reward of 0.8. This is a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Red Button:** Pressed 10 times with an average reward of 0.8. This is also a strong candidate for exploitation, but it has been pressed more than the blue button, so we might want to explore other options a bit more.
   - **Orange and Brown Buttons:** Both have been pressed 3 times with an average reward of 0.6666666666666666. These are decent but not as high as blue or red.
   - **Green Button:** Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is a moderate reward but worth exploring further.
   - **Yellow, Purple, Pink, Black, White Buttons:** Each pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons need more exploration to determine their true potential.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - **Exploitation:** Blue and Red buttons are the top performers so far. Given that Red has been pressed more, we might lean towards Blue to balance exploration and exploitation.
   - **Exploration:** The buttons with only one press (Yellow, Purple, Pink, Black, White) need more exploration. However, since their average reward is 0.0, they are less promising compared to the others.

3. **Final Choice:**
   - Given the high average reward and fewer presses compared to Red, the **Blue button** is a good choice for the next press to maximize immediate reward while still allowing for exploration in future steps.

- **Yellow, purple, pink, black, and white buttons** have all been pressed once and have an average reward of 0.0, but this could be due to low sample size.

- **Yellow, purple, pink, black, and white buttons** are worth exploring as they have been pressed only once and their true potential is still unknown.

Given the current data, the **blue button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, making it a good choice for exploitation. However, to ensure we are not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should also consider exploring under-pressed buttons.

Since the **blue button** has shown consistent high rewards and has been pressed fewer times than the red button, it is a strong candidate for the next press.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Brown**: 0.6666666666666666 (pressed 3 times)
   - **Red**: 0.6428571428571429 (pressed 14 times)
   - **Blue**: 0.5714285714285714 (pressed 7 times)

2. **Exploration**: Several buttons have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, which could be misleading due to insufficient data:
   - **Yellow**, **Purple**, **Pink**, **Black**, **White**

3. **Decision**:
   - **Brown** has the highest average reward but has been pressed only 3 times, so it’s worth pressing again to confirm its high reward potential.
   - **Red** has a slightly lower average reward than **Brown** but has been pressed 14 times, indicating more reliable data.
   - **Blue** has a decent average reward and has been pressed 7 times, but it’s not as high as **Brown** or **Red**.
   - The buttons with only one press and 0.0 reward (**Yellow**, **Purple**, **Pink**, **Black**, **White**) are risky but could potentially yield higher rewards if explored further.

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, **Brown** seems like the best choice because it has the highest average reward so far and has been pressed fewer times compared to **Red**, allowing us to gather more data on its potential.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Red Button**: Pressed 14 times with an average reward of 0.642857. This is the highest average reward among the buttons that have been pressed more than once. It seems like a good candidate for exploitation.
2. **Blue Button**: Pressed 7 times with an average reward of 0.571429. This is the second-highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times. It's also a good candidate for exploitation.
3. **Green Button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. It has potential but needs more exploration.
4. **Orange and Brown Buttons**: Both pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.5. They are performing moderately and could be explored further.
5. **Yellow, Purple, Pink, Black, White Buttons**: Each pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons need more exploration to determine their true potential.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: Focus on buttons with high average rewards and sufficient data (Red and Blue).
- **Exploration**: Allocate some trials to buttons with fewer presses to gather more data (Green, Orange, Brown, and the once-pressed buttons).

Given the current data, the **Red Button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a significant number of times, making it a strong candidate for exploitation. However, to ensure we don't miss out on potentially better buttons, we should also consider exploring buttons with fewer presses.

### Decision:
Since the **Red Button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be somewhat reliable, it is a good choice for the next press.

   - **Red button**: 0.6 average reward over 15 presses.
   - **Blue button**: 0.5714 average reward over 7 presses.

2. **Exploration**: Several buttons have been pressed only once or a few times, and their average rewards are either 0 or 0.5. These buttons could potentially have higher rewards, but we need more data to confirm:
   - **Yellow, Purple, Pink, Black, White**: Each pressed once with 0 reward.
   - **Green**: Pressed twice with 0.5 average reward.
   - **Orange, Brown**: Each pressed 4 times with 0.5 average reward.

3. **Decision**: Given that we have 63 remaining time steps, it’s still worth exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options. However, we should also continue exploiting the buttons that have shown good performance.

**Strategy**:
- Prioritize **Red** and **Blue** for exploitation since they have the highest average rewards.
- Allocate some presses to **Yellow, Purple, Pink, Black, White** to explore their potential, as they have been pressed only once.

**Next Choice**: Since **Red** has the highest average reward and has been pressed more times than **Blue**, it’s a safer choice for exploitation. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider pressing one of the under-explored buttons.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.625) among all buttons, and it has been pressed 8 times, which is a reasonable number of trials to estimate its mean. This makes it a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **purple**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, since they have been pressed so few times, their true reward potential is still highly uncertain. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.

3. **Balancing Act**: Given that we have 58 remaining time steps (100 - 42), we can afford to explore a bit more while still focusing on exploiting the best-known option. However, the blue button’s high average reward and reasonable number of trials make it the most promising choice for now.

**Conclusion**: The **blue button** is the best choice at this stage due to its high average reward and sufficient exploration.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.6666666666666666) among all buttons, based on 9 presses. This suggests it might be the best option so far.
   
2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **purple**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** have been pressed only once, and their average rewards are 0.0. However, this could be due to bad luck, and they might actually have higher rewards. Similarly, **yellow** has been pressed twice with an average reward of 0.0, but it’s worth exploring further.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only 43 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room to explore. However, the **blue button** has shown consistent good performance, so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.

4. **Decision**: Given the blue button’s high average reward and the need to maximize total reward, it’s a safe and strategic choice to press it again. Exploration can be done later with less-pressed buttons.

- **Yellow, purple, pink, black, and white buttons** have all been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have shown no reward (average reward of 0.0).

2. **Exploring** the buttons that have been pressed fewer times, especially those with potential but insufficient data (like green).

2. **Exploration**: Several buttons (green, yellow, purple, pink, black, white) have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have low or zero average rewards. However, their true reward means could still be higher, and we need more data to confirm.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only 51 time steps in (with 49 remaining), we still have room to explore. However, the blue button’s high average reward makes it a safer choice for now. Exploring buttons with very few presses (like purple, pink, black, white) could be risky but might yield higher rewards if their true means are higher than expected.

4. **Decision**: Given the blue button’s strong performance and the need to maximize immediate rewards, we’ll prioritize exploitation over exploration for this step.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.6666666666666666) among all buttons, based on 18 presses. This suggests it is a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **purple, pink, black, and white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to bad luck, and they might have higher true means. Similarly, **green and yellow** have been pressed only twice, with green showing a moderate reward (0.5) and yellow showing 0.0. These buttons could still be worth exploring.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we have 48 time steps remaining (100 - 52), we should prioritize exploitation to maximize rewards but still allocate some presses to explore under-sampled buttons.

**Decision**: Given the blue button's strong performance and the need to maximize rewards, we'll prioritize it for now. However, we should keep in mind to explore other buttons, especially those with very few presses, in subsequent steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button**: Highest number of presses (22) with a solid average reward of 0.5454545454545454.  
   - **Red button**: Second-highest number of presses (18) with a slightly higher average reward of 0.5555555555555556.  
   - **Green, Orange, Brown**: Fewer presses but decent average rewards (0.5).  
   - **Yellow, Purple, Pink, Black, White**: Very few presses and low or zero average rewards.  

2. **Current Best Options**:  
   - The **red button** has a slightly higher average reward than the **blue button** and has been pressed fewer times, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - The **blue button** is also a good option due to its consistent performance.  

3. **Exploration Consideration**:  
   - Buttons like **green, orange, and brown** have been pressed fewer times but show potential. However, their average rewards are not significantly higher than the red or blue buttons.  
   - Buttons like **yellow, purple, pink, black, and white** have very low or zero rewards and have been pressed very few times, making them less attractive for exploitation but worth exploring if we have spare time steps.  

4. **Decision**:

   - The **blue** button has the highest average reward (0.5217) and has been pressed 23 times, making it a reliable choice.  
   - The **red** button has a slightly higher average reward (0.5263) than blue but has been pressed fewer times (19). It’s also a strong candidate.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button**: Highest number of presses (23) with a decent average reward (0.5217).  
   - **Red button**: Second-highest number of presses (21) with the highest average reward (0.5714).  
   - **Green, Orange, Brown**: Fewer presses but consistent average rewards (0.5).  
   - **Yellow, Purple, Pink, Black, White**: Very few presses and low or zero average rewards.  

2. **Focus on High-Reward Buttons**:  
   The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.5714) among the frequently pressed buttons, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.  

3. **Exploration of Under-Pressed Buttons**:  
   Buttons like **green, orange, brown** have fewer presses but consistent rewards. Exploring these could reveal higher rewards, but the risk is low since their average rewards are already decent.  

4. **Decision**:  
   Given the remaining time steps (40), it’s better to focus on the button with the highest proven reward to maximize immediate gains. The **red button** is the best choice based on current data.

From the summary:
- **Red button** has the highest average reward (0.5909) and has been pressed 22 times.
- **Blue button** has the second-highest average reward (0.5217) and has been pressed 23 times.
- **Green, orange, and brown buttons** have an average reward of 0.5, but they have been pressed fewer times (2, 4, and 4 times respectively).
- **Yellow, purple, pink, black, and white buttons** have an average reward of 0.0, but they have been pressed very few times (2, 1, 1, 1, and 1 times respectively).

Given that we have 39 time steps remaining, it's still worth exploring the buttons that have been pressed fewer times to ensure we're not missing out on potentially higher rewards. However, the **red button** has shown the highest average reward so far and has been pressed a reasonable number of times, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration:** With 39 time steps left, we should continue to explore buttons that have been pressed fewer times, but also exploit the best-known option.
2. **Highest Average Reward:** The red button has the highest average reward (0.5909) and has been pressed 22 times, which is a good balance between exploration and exploitation.
3. **Exploration Candidates:** Buttons like yellow, purple, pink, black, and white have very low average rewards but have been pressed very few times. Exploring these could reveal higher rewards, but the risk is higher.

**Decision:**
Given the current data, the **red button** remains the best choice for exploitation, as it has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be relatively confident in its performance. However, to ensure we're not missing out on potentially better options, we should also consider exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times in future steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.6087) among the buttons pressed more than once. It’s a strong candidate for exploitation since it has consistently provided higher rewards compared to others.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **green, orange, and brown** have been pressed only a few times and have moderate average rewards (0.5). However, since their sample size is small, their true reward potential is still uncertain. Buttons like **yellow, purple, pink, black, and white** have been pressed very few times and have shown 0 reward so far, but this could be due to chance. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.

3. **Current Strategy**: Given that we’re only 62 time steps in (with 38 remaining), we should prioritize exploitation of the **red button** since it has the highest proven reward. However, we should also allocate some time steps to explore under-sampled buttons to avoid missing out on potentially better options.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.655) among the buttons that have been pressed multiple times. It has been pressed 29 times, which is a reasonable sample size to trust its average reward.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **green, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white** have been pressed fewer times, and some have not been pressed enough to determine their true potential. However, since we only have 32 time steps left (100 - 68 = 32), we need to prioritize exploitation over exploration to maximize immediate rewards.

3. **Decision**: Given the high average reward of the **red button** and the limited time left, it is the best choice to maximize the total reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Red button** has the highest average reward (0.6666666666666666) and has been pressed 30 times, indicating it’s a reliable choice.  
   - **Blue button** has a decent average reward (0.5217391304347826) and has been pressed 23 times, making it another strong candidate.  
   - Other buttons like **green**, **orange**, and **brown** have lower or equal average rewards but have been pressed fewer times, so they might still have potential.  
   - Buttons like **yellow**, **purple**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** have very low or zero average rewards and have been pressed very few times, so they are less promising but could still be worth exploring.

2. **Current Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only 31 time steps left (100 - 69 = 31), we should focus more on **exploitation** to maximize rewards, but still allocate some steps to **exploration** for buttons that have been pressed fewer times.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed sufficiently to be confident in its performance. It’s the best choice for exploitation.  
   - However, we should also consider exploring buttons like **green**, **orange**, or **brown** that have been pressed fewer times but have shown some potential.  

Given the remaining time steps and the need to maximize rewards, the **red button** is the most reliable choice for now.

### Analysis:
1. **Exploitation**:
   - **Red button**: Highest average reward (0.645) with 31 presses. This is the most reliable choice based on current data.
   - **Blue button**: Second-highest average reward (0.522) with 23 presses. A solid alternative but slightly lower than red.

2. **Exploration**:
   - **Green, Orange, Brown**: These buttons have been pressed only 2-4 times and have an average reward of 0.5. They might have higher potential but need more data.
   - **Yellow, Purple, Pink, Black, White**: These buttons have been pressed 1-2 times and have an average reward of 0.0. They are risky but could yield higher rewards if explored further.

### Strategy:
- **Prioritize Red**: Given its high average reward and sufficient data, pressing the red button is the safest choice to maximize immediate reward.
- **Explore Sparingly**: Allocate a few presses to under-explored buttons (e.g., green, orange, brown) to gather more data, but focus primarily on exploitation.

### Decision:
For the next press, prioritize the **red button** to maximize the expected reward based on current data.

   - Since we have only 24 time steps left (100 - 76 = 24), we should focus more on **exploitation** to maximize rewards rather than spending too much time on exploration.  
   - The **red button** is the best candidate for exploitation given its high average reward and sufficient data to support its reliability.

3. **Final Decision**:  
   - We will choose the **red button** to maximize the expected reward in the remaining time steps.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.6842) and has been pressed 38 times, indicating a reliable estimate.  
   - The **blue button** has a lower average reward (0.5217) but has been pressed 23 times, suggesting a stable estimate.  
   - Other buttons like **green, orange, and brown** have lower average rewards but fewer presses, leaving room for potential higher rewards.  
   - Buttons like **yellow, purple, pink, black, and white** have very low or zero rewards but have been pressed only once or twice, so their true potential is still uncertain.  

2. **Prioritizing High-Reward Buttons**:  
   - The **red button** is the clear leader in terms of average reward and has been sufficiently explored, making it a safe choice for exploitation.  

3. **Exploring Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - While exploration is important, with only 23 time steps left, focusing on the highest-reward button is more critical to maximize total reward.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 15 time steps, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons with the highest known average rewards and exploring the buttons with fewer presses to gather more information about their potential rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.652) and has been pressed 46 times, indicating a relatively reliable estimate.  
   - The **blue button** has a lower average reward (0.522) but has been pressed 23 times, also providing a decent estimate.  
   - Other buttons (green, orange, brown) have lower or equal average rewards but fewer presses, suggesting they might be worth exploring.  
   - Buttons like yellow, purple, pink, black, and white have very low or zero average rewards and minimal presses, making them less attractive for exploitation but still candidates for exploration.

2. **Prioritizing Exploitation**:  
   Given that we only have 15 time steps left, prioritizing exploitation of the button with the highest known reward is the safest strategy to maximize total reward. The **red button** is the clear choice for exploitation.

3. **Exploration Consideration**:  
   While exploration could reveal higher rewards for under-pressed buttons, the risk of wasting time steps on low-reward buttons is too high with only 15 steps remaining.

**Final Decision**:  
The **red button** is the best choice to maximize the total reward in the remaining time steps.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.6296) and has been pressed 54 times, indicating a reliable estimate of its mean. The **blue button** also has a decent average reward (0.5217) but is slightly lower than the red button.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **green, orange, and brown** have been pressed only 2-4 times and have an average reward of 0.5. While this is lower than the red button, they could potentially have higher means if explored further. However, with only 7 time steps left, the risk of exploring these buttons may not outweigh the potential reward.

3. **Under-explored buttons**: Buttons like **yellow, purple, pink, black, and white** have been pressed only 1-2 times and have an average reward of 0.0. While their true means could be higher, the limited data and remaining time steps make them high-risk choices.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 6 time steps, we need to consider both the **exploitation** (choosing buttons with known high rewards) and **exploration** (trying buttons with fewer samples to gather more information). Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.6363636363636364) and has been pressed 55 times, indicating a reliable estimate. The **blue button** also has a decent average reward (0.5217391304347826) but is lower than the red button.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **green, orange, and brown** have fewer samples (2-4 presses) and an average reward of 0.5, which is not bad but not as high as the red button. Buttons like **yellow, purple, pink, black, and white** have very few samples (1-2 presses) and low or zero average rewards, but they could potentially have higher means that we haven’t discovered yet.

3. **Trade-off**: With only 6 time steps left, exploration is less critical because we won’t have enough time to gather sufficient data to confidently switch to a new button. Therefore, **exploitation** is the better strategy.

4. **Decision**: The **red button** has the highest average reward and a reliable estimate, making it the best choice to maximize the total reward in the remaining time steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Evaluate the average rewards**:  
   - **Red button**: 0.642857 (highest average reward)  
   - **Blue button**: 0.521739  
   - **Green, Orange, Brown buttons**: 0.5  
   - **Yellow, Purple, Pink, Black, White buttons**: 0.0  

2. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**:  
   - The red button has the highest average reward and has been pressed 56 times, indicating a reliable estimate.  
   - Other buttons with fewer presses (e.g., green, orange, brown) have lower average rewards and are less explored, but their potential is uncertain.  
   - Buttons with 0.0 average reward (yellow, purple, pink, black, white) are unlikely to yield better results.  

3. **Decision**:  
   Since the red button has the highest average reward and a sufficient number of trials to confirm its reliability, it is the best choice to maximize the total reward in the remaining time steps.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Average Rewards**:  
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.6316) among the buttons pressed more than once.  
   - The **blue button** has a lower average reward (0.5217) compared to red.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - Buttons like **green, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white** have been pressed very few times (1-4 times), so their average rewards are less reliable.  
   - However, with only 4 time steps left, exploring these buttons is risky because their average rewards are either low (0.0 or 0.5) or uncertain.  

3. **Optimal Strategy**:  
   - Given the limited time steps remaining, it’s best to **exploit** the button with the highest known average reward, which is the **red button**.
