A balanced approach would be to continue exploiting the blue button, which has shown a good reward, while also exploring other buttons to gather more data. Since we have only 100 time steps, we need to be strategic about how we allocate our presses.

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has been pressed 2 times with an average reward of 1.0, which is the highest observed reward so far. This suggests that the blue button might be a good choice to maximize immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: The **red, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons** have not been pressed yet. We don’t know their reward distributions, so pressing one of these buttons could reveal valuable information.

3. **Trade-off**: Since we have only 100 time steps, we need to be strategic. Early on, it’s beneficial to explore more to gather data, but we also want to exploit the best-known option to accumulate rewards.

4. **Decision**: Given that we’ve only played 3 times so far, exploration is still important. However, the blue button has shown strong performance, and pressing it again could yield a high reward.

At the same time, we should start exploring other buttons to avoid missing out on potentially better options.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between **exploitation** (choosing buttons that have already shown high rewards) and **exploration** (trying buttons that haven't been pressed yet to gather more information about their potential rewards).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has been pressed 8 times with an average reward of 0.75, which is the highest average reward so far. This suggests that the blue button is a good choice for maximizing immediate rewards.

2. **Exploration**: The **green**, **red**, **yellow**, **purple**, **orange**, **brown**, **pink**, **black**, and **white** buttons have either been pressed very few times (green and red) or not at all. We don’t have enough information about their reward distributions, so exploring these buttons could potentially reveal higher rewards.

3. **Current Strategy**: Since we’ve only played 10 times out of 100, we still have a lot of time to explore. However, the blue button has already demonstrated a strong performance, and we should continue to exploit it while gradually exploring other buttons.

4. **Decision**: Given the high average reward of the blue button and the early stage of the game, it’s reasonable to press the blue button again to maximize immediate rewards while leaving room for exploration later.

The other buttons (yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their potential rewards.

To maximize the total reward, we should prioritize the button with the highest known average reward, which is the **blue button**. However, it's also important to explore other buttons to gather more information, as they might have higher rewards that we are not yet aware of.

Given that we have only 100 time steps and we've already used 11, we need to balance exploitation (choosing the best-known option) with exploration (trying other options to gather more data). Since the **blue button** has a strong track record so far, it's a safe choice for exploitation.

However, to ensure we don't miss out on potentially better options, we should also consider exploring one of the untested buttons. But for this step, since the **blue button** has proven to be reliable, we'll stick with it for now.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.7) based on 10 trials.
2. The **green** and **red** buttons have been tried once with no reward, but this is not enough to conclude they are worse than the blue button.

From the summary:
- The **blue button** has been pressed 16 times with an average reward of 0.5625, which is the highest average reward observed so far. This suggests that the blue button is a good candidate for exploitation.
- The **green button** and **red button** have been pressed 2 and 1 times, respectively, with average rewards of 0.0. These buttons have not shown any reward yet, but they haven't been explored much.
- The remaining buttons (yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards.

However, the **green** and **red** buttons have been pressed only 2 and 1 times, respectively, with average rewards of 0.0. This suggests that these buttons might have higher potential rewards but haven't been explored enough.

To maximize total reward, we should balance **exploitation** (choosing the button with the highest known reward) and **exploration** (trying under-explored buttons to discover potentially better options). Since the green and red buttons have been pressed very few times, it’s worth exploring them further.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. The blue button is the safest choice with a proven average reward.
2. The green and red buttons have not been explored enough and could have higher rewards.
3. Given the limited exploration of the green button (only 2 presses), it’s a good candidate for exploration.

**Decision:** Let’s explore the **green button** to gather more data and potentially discover a higher reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has been pressed 17 times and has an average reward of 0.5294. This is the highest average reward among all buttons, making it the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: The **green button** and **red button** have been pressed 3 and 1 times, respectively, with average rewards of 0.0. This could mean they are low-reward buttons, but it’s also possible that they haven’t been pressed enough to reveal their true potential. The remaining buttons (yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed at all, so we have no information about their rewards.

3. **Current Strategy**: Since we’re only 21 time steps into 100, it’s still early to focus solely on exploitation. We should allocate some time steps to explore the unpressed buttons to gather more data.

4. **Decision**: Given the blue button’s strong performance so far, it’s a good candidate for exploitation. However, to balance exploration, we should also consider trying one of the unpressed buttons. Since the green and red buttons have already been tried with no reward, it’s more valuable to explore a completely untested button.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**:  
   - The **blue button** has been pressed 17 times with an average reward of 0.5294. This is the most reliable option so far, as it has the highest average reward among the buttons that have been pressed.  
   - The **yellow button** has been pressed only once but gave a reward of 1.0. While this looks promising, it’s based on a single observation, so it’s less reliable than the blue button.  

2. **Exploration**:  
   - The **green button** and **red button** have been pressed a few times but yielded no rewards (average 0.0). These buttons seem less promising but could still be worth exploring further.  
   - The **purple, orange, brown, pink, black, and white buttons** have not been pressed at all. These are completely unexplored and could potentially have high rewards.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - Given that we’re only 22 time steps into 100, there’s still ample time to explore. However, the **blue button** remains the most reliable choice for exploitation, as it has a consistent track record of providing rewards.  
   - The **yellow button** is tempting due to its high reward, but it’s based on only one trial, so it’s riskier.  
   - Exploring the **unpressed buttons** (e.g., purple, orange, etc.) could yield higher rewards, but it’s a gamble.  

**Conclusion**:  
To balance exploitation and exploration, the **blue button** is the safest choice for now, as it has the highest proven average reward. However, we should consider exploring other buttons, especially the **yellow button** or an unpressed button, in the next few steps.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button**: Has been pressed 21 times with an average reward of 0.5238. This is the most frequently pressed button and has a decent average reward, so it’s a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - **Orange button**: Pressed only once with a reward of 1.0, which is the highest observed reward so far. However, this is based on a single observation, so it’s worth exploring further.  
   - **Yellow button**: Pressed twice with an average reward of 0.5, which is lower than blue but still decent.  
   - **Green, Red, Purple**: These buttons have been pressed a few times but have yielded no rewards (average 0.0), so they are less promising for exploitation.  
   - **Brown, Pink, Black, White**: These buttons have not been pressed at all, so they are completely unexplored and could potentially yield high rewards.  

2. **Decision**:  
   - The **blue button** is a safe choice for exploitation, given its consistent performance.  
   - The **orange button** is intriguing because of its high reward on the single press, but it’s risky to rely on such limited data.  
   - Unexplored buttons (brown, pink, black, white) could have high rewards, but pressing them is a gamble with no prior information.  

3. **Conclusion**:  
   Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, the **blue button** remains the most reliable choice at this stage, as it has the highest average reward based on sufficient data. However, to avoid missing out on potentially better options, we should also consider exploring the **orange button** or an unexplored button occasionally.  

For this step, I’ll prioritize exploitation with the **blue button** to maximize immediate reward while keeping in mind the need to explore other buttons in future steps.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button**: Pressed 22 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is the most frequently pressed button and has a decent average reward, so it’s a safe choice for exploitation.  
   - **Yellow button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. This button has a similar average reward to the blue button but has been pressed much less, so it could be worth exploring further.  
   - **Orange button**: Pressed 1 time with an average reward of 1.0. This is the highest reward observed so far, but it’s based on only one trial, so it’s worth exploring more.  
   - **Green, Red, Purple buttons**: Pressed 3, 1, and 1 times respectively, all with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not shown any reward yet, but they could still be worth exploring since they’ve been pressed very few times.  
   - **Brown, Pink, Black, White buttons**: Pressed 0 times. These buttons are completely unexplored and could have high rewards, so they are prime candidates for exploration.

2. **Strategy**:  
   Given that we have 70 time steps remaining, we should prioritize exploring buttons that have been pressed very few times or not at all, while still occasionally exploiting the buttons with known decent rewards (like blue and yellow).  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Orange button** has the highest observed reward but needs more exploration.  
   - **Brown, Pink, Black, White buttons** are completely unexplored and could have high rewards.

   - **Exploitation**: Choose a button with a high average reward (blue, yellow, orange, or pink) to maximize immediate reward.  
   - **Exploration**: Test buttons with fewer trials (e.g., black or white) to gather more information and potentially discover a better option.

5. **Decision**:

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Black button**: Average reward of 1.0 (pressed only once).
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of 0.5 (pressed 22 times).
   - **Yellow button**: Average reward of 0.5 (pressed 2 times).
   - **Orange button**: Average reward of 0.5 (pressed 4 times).
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of 0.5 (pressed 2 times).

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times or not at all, and their true reward potential is still uncertain:
   - **Red button**: Pressed once with average reward 0.0.
   - **Purple button**: Pressed once with average reward 0.0.
   - **Brown button**: Pressed once with average reward 0.0.
   - **White button**: Pressed 0 times.

3. **Decision**:
   - The **black button** has the highest average reward (1.0), but it has only been pressed once, so its true reward potential is still uncertain.
   - The **blue button** has a consistent average reward of 0.5 and has been pressed many times, making it a reliable choice.
   - The **white button** has not been pressed at all, so we have no information about its reward potential.

Given that we are only 37 time steps in and have 63 more to go, it’s important to explore buttons that haven’t been pressed much to gather more information. However, since the **black button** showed a high reward in its only trial, it’s worth pressing it again to confirm its potential.

### Analysis:
1. **Exploitation**:  
   - The **blue**, **yellow**, **orange**, **pink**, and **black** buttons have the highest average rewards (0.5) among the buttons that have been pressed.  
   - The **blue** button has been pressed the most (22 times) and consistently yields an average reward of 0.5, making it a reliable choice.  

2. **Exploration**:  
   - Buttons like **red**, **purple**, and **brown** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0, but this could be due to chance. They need more exploration to confirm their true reward potential.  
   - The **white** button has not been pressed at all, so its reward distribution is completely unknown.  

3. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have 62 remaining time steps (100 - 38), we can afford to explore buttons that haven't been pressed much while still exploiting the best-known options.  
   - The **white** button is the most unexplored, so it’s a good candidate for exploration.  

### Decision:  
Given the need to balance exploitation and exploration, I will choose the **white** button to gather more information about its reward distribution.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **blue (0.5)**, **yellow (0.5)**, **orange (0.5)**, **pink (0.5)**, and **black (0.5)**. These buttons have shown promising results and should be prioritized.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **green**, **red**, **purple**, **brown**, and **white** have been pressed fewer times and have an average reward of 0.0. However, since their means are unknown, they could potentially have higher rewards. We should explore these buttons to a lesser extent to avoid missing out on better options.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we have 61 remaining time steps (100 - 39 = 61), we should focus more on exploiting the buttons with high rewards while still exploring the less-pressed buttons occasionally.

4. **Current Best Choice**: Among the buttons with the highest average reward (0.5), **blue** has been pressed the most (22 times), which gives us more confidence in its reward distribution. However, to avoid over-exploiting it, we can also consider other buttons with the same average reward but fewer presses, like **yellow**, **orange**, **pink**, or **black**.

5. **Decision**: Given that **blue** has the most data and a consistent reward, it’s a safe and strong choice. However, to balance exploration, we could also consider **yellow**, **orange**, **pink**, or **black** as alternatives.

From the summary:
- **Blue button** has the highest average reward (0.478) but has been pressed 23 times, which is a significant number of trials.
- **Yellow, orange, pink, and black buttons** all have a perfect average reward of 0.5, but they have been pressed only 2-4 times, which is not enough to be confident about their true reward rates.
- **Green, red, purple, brown, and white buttons** have all yielded 0.0 rewards, but they have been pressed very few times (1-3 times), so they might still be worth exploring.

Given that we have 60 time steps left, it's a good strategy to explore the buttons with high potential (yellow, orange, pink, black) while also not completely abandoning the blue button, which has shown consistent, albeit slightly lower, rewards.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration:** We should prioritize buttons with high average rewards but low sample sizes to better estimate their true rewards.
2. **Candidates:** Yellow, orange, pink, and black buttons are the best candidates for exploration due to their high average rewards and low press counts.
3. **Choice:** Among these, **orange** has been pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.5, which is a good balance between exploitation and exploration.

   - **Black**: Average reward of 0.5 (pressed 2 times)
   - **Blue**: Average reward of 0.4583 (pressed 24 times)
   - **Orange**: Average reward of 0.4 (pressed 5 times)

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times and could potentially have higher rewards than their current averages suggest:
   - **Red**: Pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0
   - **Purple**: Pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0
   - **Brown**: Pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0
   - **White**: Pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0
   - **Green**: Pressed 3 times, average reward 0.0
   - **Yellow**: Pressed 3 times, average reward 0.3333

3. **Decision**: Given that we have 55 time steps remaining, we should prioritize **exploitation** on buttons with high rewards while still exploring buttons that haven't been pressed much. The **pink** button has the highest average reward and has only been pressed 4 times, so it’s a good candidate for exploitation. However, the **black** button also has a high average reward and has been pressed even fewer times (2 times), making it an equally attractive choice.

Since both **pink** and **black** are strong candidates, and **black** has been pressed fewer times, we’ll choose **black** to gather more information while still aiming for a high reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **pink button** has the highest average reward (0.5) among the buttons that have been pressed more than once. However, it has only been pressed 4 times, so there’s still some uncertainty about its true mean reward.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **red**, **purple**, **brown**, and **white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. This could be due to bad luck, so exploring these buttons further might reveal higher rewards.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only 46 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room to explore. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise but haven’t been fully explored.

4. **Decision**: The **pink button** has the highest average reward so far, but it’s worth exploring buttons that haven’t been pressed much to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better options. However, given the limited data, the **pink button** remains the most promising choice for now.

   - **Purple button**: 1 press, 0.0 reward
   - **Brown button**: 1 press, 0.0 reward
   - **White button**: 1 press, 0.0 reward

3. **Balancing Act**: Given that we have 51 time steps remaining, it’s still worth exploring buttons that haven’t been pressed much, especially since their average rewards might be misleading due to the small sample size. However, the **blue button** has a consistently high average reward and has been pressed enough times to give us confidence in its performance.

**Decision**:  
- The **blue button** is the most reliable choice based on current data, as it has the highest average reward and a decent number of presses.  
- However, exploring buttons like **red**, **purple**, **brown**, or **white** could potentially uncover a higher reward, but the risk is higher.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 27 times with an average reward of 0.48148148148148145. This is the highest average reward so far, indicating it's a strong candidate for exploitation.
2. **Green, Red, Purple, Brown, White Buttons**: All have been pressed very few times (1-3 times) and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons need more exploration to determine their true potential.
3. **Yellow, Orange, Black Buttons**: Pressed 3-6 times with average rewards around 0.3333333333333333. These buttons show some potential but need further exploration.
4. **Pink Button**: Pressed 5 times with an average reward of 0.4. This is a strong contender, though slightly fewer presses than the blue button.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The blue button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, making it a safe choice for exploitation.
- **Exploration**: Buttons like green, red, purple, brown, and white have been pressed very few times and could potentially have higher rewards. Exploring these buttons could lead to discovering a better option.

### Decision:
Given that we have only 49 time steps left, we should prioritize exploitation to maximize immediate rewards while still allocating some steps for exploration. The blue button is the most promising for exploitation, but we should also explore buttons that have been pressed very few times.

Since the blue button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, it remains the best choice for this step.

4. **Decision**: Given the blue button’s strong performance and the need to maximize total reward, it’s the safest and most rewarding choice at this stage. Exploration can be done later if needed.

1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 30 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is the highest average reward so far, but it has been pressed the most, so its estimate is likely more stable.

2. **Green, Red, Purple, Brown, White Buttons**: Each has been pressed only once with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have very little data, so their true reward means are highly uncertain.

3. **Yellow, Orange, Black Buttons**: Each has been pressed 3 or 6 times with average rewards of 0.3333. These buttons have moderate data, but their average rewards are lower than the blue button.

4. **Pink Button**: Pressed 5 times with an average reward of 0.4. This button has a decent average reward and moderate data, but it is still lower than the blue button.

**Strategy**:
- The **blue button** has the highest average reward and a stable estimate due to being pressed 30 times. It is the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.
- However, exploring under-sampled buttons (like green, red, purple, brown, white) could reveal higher reward means, but this is riskier and may not pay off in the remaining 46 time steps.

Given the goal is to maximize total reward over 100 time steps, and with only 46 steps left, it is more prudent to exploit the button with the highest known reward rather than explore further.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons that have shown the highest average rewards so far and exploring other buttons that have been pressed fewer times, as they might have higher potential rewards.

1. **Exploitation**: The blue button has the highest average reward (0.5161) and has been pressed the most (31 times), indicating it's a reliable choice for a good reward.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like green, red, purple, brown, and white have been pressed very few times (1-3 times) and have shown 0 average reward. However, this could be due to the small sample size, and they might actually have higher rewards. Buttons like yellow, orange, pink, and black have been pressed a bit more and show some positive average rewards, but not as high as blue.

Given that we have 45 time steps left, it's still worth exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to ensure we're not missing out on potentially higher rewards. However, since blue has consistently shown the highest average reward and we have a good amount of data on it, it remains a strong choice for exploitation.

Considering the balance between exploitation and exploration, and given the limited information on the less-pressed buttons, the blue button remains the most promising choice based on the current data.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons that have shown the highest average rewards so far and exploring other buttons that have been pressed fewer times, as they might have higher potential rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button** has the highest average reward (0.473684) and has been pressed the most (38 times). It is the safest choice for exploitation.  
   - Other buttons like **pink** (average 0.4, pressed 5 times) and **orange** (average 0.3333, pressed 6 times) also show potential but have been explored less.  

2. **Under-explored Buttons**:  
   - Buttons like **green**, **red**, **purple**, **brown**, and **white** have been pressed only once and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons could have higher rewards but need more exploration.  
   - **Yellow** and **black** have been pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.3333, which is decent but not as high as **blue** or **pink**.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Blue** is the most reliable choice based on current data, but exploring under-explored buttons could lead to higher rewards if they turn out to be better.  
   - Given that we have 38 more time steps left (100 - 62 = 38), we can afford to explore a bit more while still exploiting the best-known option.  

**Final Choice**:  
Since **blue** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, it remains the best choice for exploitation. However, to balance exploration, we could consider pressing an under-explored button with potential.

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we still have 33 time steps left (100 - 67 = 33), it’s worth exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to gather more information about their potential rewards.

   - **Blue** is the safest choice for exploitation, but we should also consider **pink** as it has a high average reward (0.4) and has been pressed fewer times (5), making it a good candidate for further exploration.

### Analysis:
1. **Blue Button**:  
   - Pressed 45 times with an average reward of 0.4444.  
   - This is the highest average reward observed so far, making it the most promising choice for exploitation.

2. **Other Buttons**:  
   - **Green, Red, Purple, Brown, White**: These buttons have been pressed very few times (1-3 times) and have an average reward of 0.0. They are under-explored and could potentially have higher rewards.  
   - **Yellow, Orange, Pink, Black**: These buttons have been pressed 3-6 times with an average reward of 0.3333. They are moderately explored and have shown some potential, but their average reward is lower than the blue button.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The blue button has the highest average reward and is the safest choice for maximizing immediate rewards.  
- **Exploration**: Some buttons (e.g., green, red, purple, brown, white) have been pressed very few times and could have higher rewards. Exploring them could lead to better long-term gains.

### Decision:
Given that we have only 30 time steps left, the priority should be on maximizing immediate rewards while still exploring under-explored buttons. However, since the blue button has a significantly higher average reward and has been pressed many times, it remains the best choice for exploitation.

### Analysis of Past Choices and Rewards:
1. **Blue Button**: Pressed 46 times with an average reward of **0.4565**. This is the highest average reward among all buttons, indicating that the blue button is the most promising so far.
2. **Green, Red, Purple, Brown, White Buttons**: Each pressed only once with an average reward of **0.0**. These buttons have not been explored enough to determine their true potential.
3. **Yellow, Orange, Pink, Black Buttons**: Each pressed 3–6 times with an average reward of **0.3333**. These buttons show some potential but are less promising than the blue button.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The blue button has the highest average reward, so continuing to press it is a safe choice to maximize immediate rewards.
- **Exploration**: However, we still have 29 time steps left (100 - 71 = 29). It’s worth exploring the buttons that have been pressed only once (Green, Red, Purple, Brown, White) to see if any of them might yield higher rewards than the blue button.

### Decision:
Given that the blue button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, it remains the best choice for exploitation. However, to ensure we don’t miss out on potentially better buttons, we should allocate some of the remaining time steps to explore the least-pressed buttons.

For this time step, since the blue button has consistently performed well, we’ll continue to exploit it while planning to explore other buttons in subsequent steps.

From the summary:
- The **blue button** has been pressed 47 times with an average reward of 0.468. This is the highest average reward among all buttons, indicating it's a strong candidate for exploitation.
- Other buttons like **green, red, purple, brown, and white** have been pressed very few times (1-3 times) and have an average reward of 0.0, suggesting they haven't yielded any rewards yet. However, this could be due to insufficient exploration.
- Buttons like **yellow, orange, pink, and black** have been pressed a few times (3-6 times) and have an average reward of 0.333, which is lower than the blue button but still positive.

Given that we have only 28 time steps left (100 - 72 = 28), we should focus more on exploiting the button with the highest known reward while still allocating some trials to explore buttons that haven't been pressed much but could potentially have higher rewards.

**Strategy:**
1. **Exploit the blue button** for most of the remaining steps since it has the highest average reward.
2. **Explore under-pressed buttons** like green, red, purple, brown, and white to ensure we're not missing out on potentially better options.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.4583) and has been pressed the most (48 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice for exploitation.  
   - Other buttons like **green, red, purple, brown, and white** have been pressed very few times (1-3 times) and have an average reward of 0.0, suggesting they might be worth exploring further.  

2. **Current Data**:  
   - **Blue** is the clear leader in terms of both average reward and number of trials.  
   - **Yellow, orange, pink, and black** have moderate average rewards (0.3333) but fewer trials, so they could be promising but need more exploration.  

3. **Strategy at This Stage**:  
   - Since we have only 27 time steps left (100 - 73 = 27), we should focus more on **exploitation** to maximize rewards while still allocating some trials to explore buttons with fewer presses but decent potential.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - **Blue** is the safest and most rewarding choice based on current data.  
   - However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially better buttons, we should allocate a few trials to **yellow, orange, pink, and black**.  

Given the limited time steps remaining, the **blue button** remains the best choice for now, as it has the highest proven reward. We can explore other buttons in subsequent steps if needed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:
   - **Blue Button**: Has been pressed 49 times with an average reward of 0.469. This is the highest average reward so far, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Other Buttons**: Most other buttons have been pressed very few times (1 to 6 times), and their average rewards are either 0.0 or 0.333. This suggests that we don't have enough information to rule them out completely, and exploration is still valuable.

2. **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Strategy**:
   - To balance exploitation and exploration, we can use a strategy like UCB, which considers both the average reward and the uncertainty (how much we still need to learn about a button).
   - The UCB formula is:  
     \[
     \text{UCB}(a) = \bar{x}_a + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln n}{n_a}}
     \]
     where:
     - \(\bar{x}_a\) is the average reward of button \(a\),
     - \(n\) is the total number of trials (74 in this case),
     - \(n_a\) is the number of times button \(a\) has been pressed.

3. **Calculating UCB for Each Button**:
   - **Blue Button**:  
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{blue}) = 0.469 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 74}{49}} \approx 0.469 + 0.238 = 0.707
     \]
   - **Green Button**:  
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{green}) = 0.0 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 74}{3}} \approx 0.0 + 1.354 = 1.354
     \]
   - **Red Button**:  
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{red}) = 0.0 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 74}{1}} \approx 0.0 + 2.345 = 2.345
     \]
   - **Yellow Button**:  
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{yellow}) = 0.333 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 74}{3}} \approx 0.333 + 1.354 = 1.687
     \]
   - **Purple Button**:  
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{purple}) = 0.0 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 74}{1}} \approx 0.0 + 2.345 = 2.345
     \]
   - **Orange Button**:  
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{orange}) = 0.333 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 74}{6}} \approx 0.333 + 0.988 = 1.321
     \]
   - **Brown Button**:  
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{brown}) = 0.0 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 74}{1}} \approx 0.0 + 2.345 = 2.345
     \]
   - **Pink Button**:  
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{pink}) = 0.333 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 74}{6}} \approx 0.333 + 0.988 = 1.321
     \]
   - **Black Button**:  
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{black}) = 0.333 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 74}{3}} \approx 0.333 + 1.354 = 1.687
     \]
   - **White Button**:  
     \[
     \text{UCB}(\text{white}) = 0.0 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 74}{1}} \approx 0.0 + 2.345 = 2.345
     \]

4. **Decision**:
   - The buttons with the highest UCB values are **Red**, **Purple**, **Brown**, and **White**, all with a UCB of 2.345. Since they have been pressed the least (only once), they offer the highest potential for exploration.
   - Among these, we can choose any one. For simplicity, let's choose **Red**.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.4706) and has been pressed the most (51 times). This suggests it is a reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: Several buttons (green, red, purple, brown, white) have been pressed very few times (1-3 times) and have an average reward of 0.0. This could mean they are either low-reward buttons or their true reward potential is still unknown. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we have 23 time steps left (100 - 77 = 23), we should allocate some steps to explore under-explored buttons while still exploiting the blue button to maximize overall reward.

4. **Decision**: Given the blue button's strong performance and the limited time left, it’s prudent to continue exploiting it while occasionally exploring other buttons. However, for this step, the blue button remains the safest choice to maximize immediate reward.

2. **Exploration**: Several buttons (green, red, purple, brown, white) have been pressed very few times (1-3 times) and have an average reward of 0.0. This could be due to bad luck or genuinely low reward probabilities. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards, but it’s risky given the limited time left.

3. **Middle Ground**: Buttons like yellow, orange, pink, and black have been pressed a moderate number of times (3-6) and have an average reward of 0.3333. These buttons are worth exploring further, as their reward estimates are less certain than the blue button but still show some potential.

Given the limited time (22 steps) and the need to maximize total reward, the best strategy is to primarily exploit the blue button while allocating a few steps to explore the less-pressed buttons with potential (e.g., yellow, orange, pink, black).

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons, like green, red, purple, brown, and white, have been pressed very few times (1 to 3 times) and have an average reward of 0.0.

### Analysis:
1. **Blue Button**:  
   - Pressed 59 times with an average reward of **0.4576**.  
   - This is the highest average reward among all buttons, indicating it is the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward.

2. **Other Buttons**:  
   - **Green, Red, Purple, Brown, White**: These buttons have been pressed very few times (1-3 times) and have an average reward of **0.0**. They are under-explored but have shown no reward so far.  
   - **Yellow, Orange, Pink, Black**: These buttons have been pressed 3-6 times with an average reward of **0.3333**. They are moderately explored and offer a lower but consistent reward compared to the blue button.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation**: The blue button has the highest average reward and is the safest choice to maximize immediate reward.  
- **Exploration**: However, with only 15 time steps left, exploring under-explored buttons (e.g., Green, Red, Purple, Brown, White) could reveal higher rewards, but the risk is high given their current average of 0.0.  

Given the limited time and the clear advantage of the blue button, the optimal choice is to **exploit the blue button** to maximize the total reward.

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - The **blue button** has the highest average reward (0.45) and has been pressed the most (60 times), indicating it’s a reliable choice for exploitation.  
   - Other buttons like **yellow**, **orange**, **pink**, and **black** have lower but non-zero average rewards and have been pressed fewer times, suggesting they could be worth exploring further.  

2. **Current Data**:  
   - The **blue button** has a clear lead in both average reward and number of trials.  
   - Buttons like **green**, **red**, **purple**, **brown**, and **white** have been pressed very few times and have an average reward of 0.0, making them less attractive unless we want to explore them further.  

3. **Remaining Time Steps**:  
   - We have 14 time steps left (100 - 86 = 14). Given the limited time, focusing on the button with the highest known reward is a safer strategy.  

4. **Decision**:

   - **Other Buttons:** Most have been pressed fewer than 10 times, and their average rewards are either 0.0 or 0.3333. This suggests that we don't have enough information to rule them out completely.

2. **Remaining Time Steps:**

. **Exploration Strategy:**
   - Buttons like **green, red, purple, brown, and white** have been pressed very few times and have an average reward of 0.0. However, given the limited time, exploring these buttons might not yield significant gains unless we suspect their true rewards are much higher.
   - Buttons like **yellow, orange, pink, and black** have shown some potential with an average reward of 0.3333, but they have been pressed fewer times compared to blue.

4. **Decision:**
   - Given the high average reward and the number of times the **blue button** has been pressed, it remains the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate rewards.
   - However, to ensure we are not missing out on potentially higher rewards, we could allocate a few of the remaining steps to explore buttons like **yellow, orange, pink, or black**, which have shown some promise.

**Final Decision:**
Given the limited time and the need to maximize rewards, the **blue button** remains the best choice for now, but we should consider exploring other promising buttons in the next few steps.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **green, red, purple, brown, and white** have been pressed very few times (1-3 times) and have an average reward of 0.0. This could mean they are either low-reward buttons or their true rewards are still unknown. Exploring these buttons could reveal higher rewards, but it’s risky given the limited time left.

3. **Balancing Exploitation and Exploration**: Given only 7 time steps remain, the focus should be on **exploitation** rather than exploration, as there isn’t enough time to gather meaningful data from under-explored buttons. The **blue button** remains the best choice based on its proven higher average reward.

1. **Blue Button**: It has been pressed 68 times with an average reward of 0.47058823529411764. This is the highest average reward among all buttons and has been tested the most, indicating a relatively stable estimate.

2. **Other Buttons**: Most other buttons (green, red, purple, brown, white) have been pressed very few times (1-3 times) and have an average reward of 0.0, which is not informative due to the small sample size. Buttons like yellow, orange, pink, and black have been pressed a few more times (3-6 times) and have an average reward of 0.3333333333333333, which is lower than the blue button's average.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: With only 6 time steps remaining (100 - 94 = 6), the focus should be on **exploitation** rather than exploration, as there isn't enough time to gather significant new information about the under-explored buttons.

4. **Best Choice**: The blue button has the highest average reward and a large number of trials, making it the most reliable choice to maximize the total reward in the remaining time steps.
