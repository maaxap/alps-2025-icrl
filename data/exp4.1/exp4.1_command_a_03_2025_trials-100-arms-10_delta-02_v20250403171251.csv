A common strategy in such scenarios is to use a **bandit algorithm** like **Epsilon-Greedy**, **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**, or **Thompson Sampling**. However, since we have no data yet, the simplest approach is to start by exploring each button equally.

Given that all buttons have been pressed 0 times, we can arbitrarily choose any button to start. Let's choose the **blue** button as our first choice to begin the exploration process.

   - **Exploration**: We have 98 time steps left, and we need to learn about the other buttons. However, since we only have data for 2 buttons, it’s still early to explore too much.

   - **Exploration**: We have not tried the other buttons yet, and some of them might have higher average rewards than the red button. However, since we only have 100 time steps, we need to be strategic about exploration.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Given that we are early in the process (only 3 time steps out of 100), it’s still a good idea to explore a bit more to gather more information. However, since the red button has shown a promising reward, it’s reasonable to press it again to confirm its performance.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the 100 time steps, we need to balance between **exploitation** (choosing buttons that have already shown good rewards) and **exploration** (trying buttons that haven't been pressed much to gather more information about their potential rewards).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **green button** has the highest average reward so far (1.0), based on a single press. This suggests it might be the best choice if we only exploit.
   
2. **Exploration**: Several buttons (brown, pink, black, white) have not been pressed at all. We need to explore these to understand their potential rewards. However, since we only have 100 time steps, we should prioritize exploration early on.

3. **Current Strategy**: Since we’ve only played 9 times, it’s still early in the game. We should prioritize exploring buttons that haven’t been pressed yet to gather more data.

4. **Choice**: Among the unexplored buttons, we can choose any one. Let’s start with **brown** since it’s the first in the list of unexplored buttons.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - **Exploitation**: The green button has the highest observed reward, but we only have one data point, so its true mean could be lower.  
   - **Exploration**: The pink, black, and white buttons are completely unexplored, and one of them could have a higher mean reward than the green button.

From the summary:
- **Green button** has the highest average reward (1.0) but has only been pressed once.
- **Red button** has a moderate average reward (0.5) and has been pressed 4 times, giving us more confidence in its reward distribution.
- All other buttons (blue, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink) have been pressed once and have an average reward of 0.0.
- **Black** and **white** buttons have not been pressed yet, so their rewards are completely unknown.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Exploitation:** The green button has the highest observed reward, but we only have one data point. It’s a strong candidate but needs more exploration to confirm its reliability.
2. **Exploration:** The black and white buttons are completely unexplored. Trying them could reveal higher rewards than what we’ve seen so far.
3. **Balancing act:** Since we’re early in the 100 time steps (only 11 steps completed), exploration is still valuable. However, we should also exploit the best-known option to maximize immediate rewards.

**Decision:** Given the high reward from the green button and the need to confirm its reliability, we’ll choose it again to gather more data. If it continues to perform well, it will become a strong candidate for exploitation in future steps.

1. **Evaluate the current data**:
   - **Black button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 1.0. This is the highest average reward so far, but it’s based on only 2 trials, so there’s still uncertainty.
   - **Red button**: Pressed 4 times with an average reward of 0.5. This is a decent reward, but it’s based on more trials, so it’s more reliable.
   - **Green button**: Pressed 2 times with an average reward of 0.5. Similar to the red button but with fewer trials.
   - **Other buttons (blue, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink)**: Pressed 1 time each with an average reward of 0.0. These buttons have not shown any reward yet, but they have been pressed only once, so there’s still potential.

2. **Balance exploration and exploitation**:
   - **Exploitation**: The black button has the highest average reward, so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - **Exploration**: Buttons like white, which hasn’t been pressed at all, and others with only one press (blue, yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink) should be explored to gather more data.

3. **Decision**:
   - Given the high average reward of the black button and the need to confirm its performance, it’s a good choice for the next press.
   - However, since we also need to explore, pressing the white button, which hasn’t been pressed yet, is also a reasonable choice.

Given the current data, the **black button** has the highest average reward and is based on fewer trials compared to the red button, making it a good candidate for further exploitation to confirm its high reward potential.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To make the best choice, we need to balance between **exploitation** (choosing buttons that have already shown good rewards) and **exploration** (trying buttons that haven't been pressed much to gather more information about their potential rewards).

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The **black button** has the highest average reward (0.6667) and has been pressed 6 times, which is a decent number of trials to trust its average. It seems like a safe bet for a good reward.

2. **Exploration**: The **white button** has not been pressed at all, so we have no information about its reward distribution. Exploring it could reveal a potentially better option.

3. **Other Buttons**: The **green** and **red buttons** have an average reward of 0.5, but they’ve been pressed more than the unexplored buttons. The **blue, yellow, purple, orange, brown, and pink buttons** have all been pressed once with an average reward of 0.0, but this is based on very limited data, so they could still be worth exploring.

Given that we’re only 18 time steps in (out of 100), it’s still early to focus solely on exploitation. Exploring the **white button** could provide valuable information, but since it’s completely untested, it’s a high-risk, high-reward choice.

**Decision**: Since the **black button** has the highest proven reward and we’re still in the early stages, it’s a good balance between exploitation and exploration to stick with it for now, while keeping in mind to explore the **white button** soon.

   - This is the highest average reward among all buttons, making it the most promising for exploitation.

2. **Blue, Green, Red, White Buttons:**

   - These buttons have shown moderate potential but need more exploration to confirm their true reward rates.

3. **Yellow, Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink Buttons:**  
   - Each pressed 1 time with an average reward of 0.0.  
   - These buttons have the least data and could potentially have higher reward rates, so they are good candidates for exploration.

**Strategy:**  
Given that we have only 76 time steps remaining (100 - 24 = 76), we should prioritize exploiting the button with the highest known reward while also exploring buttons with limited data.  

- **Exploitation:** The black button has the highest average reward, so pressing it again is a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.  
- **Exploration:** Buttons like yellow, purple, orange, brown, and pink have been pressed only once and could have higher reward rates. Exploring one of these could lead to discovering a better option.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Blue button** has the highest average reward (0.6666) but has only been pressed 3 times. It’s a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **Black button** has been pressed the most (10 times) with an average reward of 0.5. It’s a safe but not optimal choice.  
   - **Yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink** have all been pressed once and yielded 0 reward. They are risky but could have higher rewards if explored further.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   Since we have only 100 time steps, we need to explore the buttons with fewer presses to understand their potential. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown some promise or have not been explored enough.  

3. **Decision**:  
   - **Blue button** is the most promising based on current data, but we should also consider exploring buttons with fewer presses to avoid missing out on potentially better rewards.  
   - **Yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink** are all tied with 0 reward and 1 press. Exploring one of these could reveal a higher reward.  

Given the current data, **blue** is the safest choice for exploitation, but exploring one of the under-explored buttons (e.g., **yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink**) could yield better long-term results.  

Since **blue** has the highest average reward and has been pressed only 3 times, it’s a good balance between exploitation and exploration.

1. **Current Data Analysis**:  
   - The **blue**, **green**, **red**, and **black** buttons have been pressed multiple times and all have an average reward of **0.5**.  
   - The **yellow**, **purple**, **orange**, **brown**, **pink**, and **white** buttons have been pressed only once or twice, and all have an average reward of **0.0**.  

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   - The buttons with **0.0** average reward have been explored very little, so their true reward potential is still uncertain.  
   - The buttons with **0.5** average reward have been explored more, but we should still consider exploring the less-pressed buttons to gather more information.  

3. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   - Since the buttons with **0.0** average reward have only been pressed once or twice, it’s worth exploring them further to confirm if their true reward is indeed low or if it was just bad luck.  
   - Among these, we can choose any one. Let’s pick **yellow** for this step.  

4. **Final Decision**:  
   We’ll choose the **yellow** button to explore its potential reward further.

1. **Average Rewards**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **blue (0.5)**, **green (0.5)**, **red (0.5)**, **black (0.5)**, and **white (0.5)**. These buttons have shown potential for higher rewards compared to the others.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Since we have 100 time steps and have only used 28 so far, we still have room to explore buttons that have been pressed fewer times to better understand their reward distributions. However, we should also exploit the buttons that have shown promising results.

3. **Under-Explored Buttons**: Buttons like **yellow**, **purple**, **orange**, **brown**, and **pink** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have an average reward of 0.0. This could be due to chance, and they might still have higher means. Exploring these buttons could potentially uncover a better option.

4. **Current Best Performers**: Among the buttons with the highest average rewards, **black** has been pressed the most (10 times), which gives us more confidence in its average reward. However, **blue**, **red**, **green**, and **white** have been pressed fewer times, leaving room for their averages to change.

Given this analysis, a balanced approach would be to **exploit** one of the buttons with a high average reward while also considering **exploration** of under-explored buttons. Since **black** has been pressed the most and has a consistent average reward, it’s a safe choice. However, to maximize potential gains, we should also consider exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times but could have higher means.

**Decision**: Let's exploit the **black** button, as it has the highest confidence in its average reward so far.

**Analysis of Current Data:**

1. **Black Button:**  
   - Pressed 11 times with an average reward of 0.5454545454545454.  
   - This is the highest average reward among all buttons, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Blue, Red, Green, White Buttons:**  
   - Each pressed 2-4 times with an average reward of 0.5.  
   - These buttons show moderate potential but have been explored less than the black button.

3. **Yellow, Purple, Orange, Brown, Pink Buttons:**  
   - Each pressed 1-2 times with an average reward of 0.0.  
   - These buttons have not shown any reward yet, but they could still have higher means; they need further exploration.

**Strategy:**  
- **Exploitation:** The black button has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, so it’s a safe choice for maximizing immediate reward.  
- **Exploration:** The buttons with zero average rewards (yellow, purple, orange, brown, pink) need more exploration to determine if they are actually low-reward or just unlucky so far.  

**Decision:**  
Given that we have 71 remaining time steps, we can afford to explore more. However, since the black button has consistently shown the highest reward, it’s a good choice to maximize immediate gains while we continue to explore other buttons in subsequent steps.

### Analysis of Current Data:
1. **Buttons with High Average Reward (0.5):**
   - **Blue (4 presses, avg 0.5)**
   - **Green (2 presses, avg 0.5)**
   - **Red (4 presses, avg 0.5)**

   - **Orange (1 press, avg 0.0)**
   - **Brown (1 press, avg 0.0)**
   - **Pink (1 press, avg 0.0)**

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation:** Focus on buttons with high average rewards (0.5) since they have proven to be reliable so far.
- **Exploration:** Some buttons (e.g., purple, orange, brown, pink) have only been pressed once and have an average reward of 0.0. This could be due to bad luck, so it's worth exploring them further to confirm their true potential.

### Decision:
- **Black** has the highest number of presses (12) with a consistent average reward of 0.5, making it a safe choice for exploitation.
- However, buttons like **purple, orange, brown,** and **pink** have been pressed only once and could potentially have higher rewards. Exploring one of these could yield better long-term results.

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **blue**, **red**, **purple**, **black**, and **white**, all with an average reward of **0.5**. Among these, **black** has been pressed the most (12 times), but its average reward remains consistent, suggesting it might be a reliable choice.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **yellow**, **orange**, **brown**, and **pink** have been pressed fewer times (2 or 1 time) and have an average reward of **0.0**. However, their low average could be due to insufficient data. It’s worth exploring these buttons further to see if they might yield higher rewards.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only 33 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room to explore. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise or have been under-explored.

Given this, let’s prioritize:
- **Black** is a safe bet for exploitation, but we’ve already pressed it 12 times.
- **Purple** and **white** have high average rewards but fewer presses, so they’re worth exploring further.
- **Yellow**, **orange**, **brown**, and **pink** need more exploration, but their current average is low.

   - **Orange**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)
   - **Brown**: 0.0 (pressed 1 time)

   - **Purple** has the highest average reward so far, but it has only been pressed 3 times, so its true mean is still uncertain.
   - **Blue**, **Red**, and **Black** have consistent rewards but have been pressed more often.
   - **Yellow**, **Orange**, **Brown**, and **Pink** have low or zero rewards but have been pressed very few times, so they could still be worth exploring.

Given that we are only 34 time steps in (out of 100), there is still ample time to explore. However, since **Purple** has shown the highest reward so far and has been pressed relatively few times, it is a good candidate for exploitation while still allowing for further exploration later.

### Analysis of Past Data:
1. **High Reward Buttons (Average Reward = 0.5):**
   - **Blue**: Pressed 4 times, average reward 0.5.
   - **Red**: Pressed 4 times, average reward 0.5.
   - **Purple**: Pressed 4 times, average reward 0.5.
   - **Black**: Pressed 12 times, average reward 0.5.
   - **White**: Pressed 2 times, average reward 0.5.

2. **Low Reward Buttons (Average Reward = 0.0):**
   - **Yellow**: Pressed 2 times, average reward 0.0.
   - **Orange**: Pressed 2 times, average reward 0.0.
   - **Brown**: Pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0.
   - **Pink**: Pressed 1 time, average reward 0.0.

3. **Moderate Reward Button:**
   - **Green**: Pressed 3 times, average reward 0.3333.

### Strategy:
- **Exploitation:** The buttons with the highest average reward (0.5) are **blue, red, purple, black,** and **white**. Among these, **black** has been pressed the most (12 times), but its average reward remains consistent. **Blue, red,** and **purple** have been pressed fewer times (4 times each) but still maintain a high average reward. **White** has been pressed only twice, so it might be worth exploring further.
  
- **Exploration:** Buttons like **yellow, orange, brown,** and **pink** have low average rewards but have been pressed very few times. It’s worth exploring these buttons to confirm if their low rewards are consistent or if they might yield higher rewards.

### Decision:
Given that we have 65 more time steps left, we should continue to explore buttons that have been pressed fewer times while also exploiting the buttons with high rewards. 

- **Black** has been pressed the most and has a consistent high reward, but we should avoid over-exploiting it too early.
- **White** has a high reward but has been pressed only twice, so it’s a good candidate for exploration.
- **Yellow, orange, brown,** and **pink** need more exploration to confirm their low rewards.

Let’s prioritize **white** for this step since it has a high reward but has been pressed the least among the high-reward buttons.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Red button**: Average reward of 0.6 (pressed 5 times).
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of 0.4 (pressed 5 times).
   - **Purple button**: Average reward of 0.5 (pressed 4 times).
   - **Black button**: Average reward of 0.5 (pressed 12 times).
   - **White button**: Average reward of 0.5 (pressed 6 times).

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times or not at all, and their true reward potential is still uncertain:
   - **Yellow button**: Average reward of 0.0 (pressed 2 times).
   - **Orange button**: Average reward of 0.0 (pressed 2 times).
   - **Brown button**: Average reward of 0.0 (pressed 1 time).
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of 0.0 (pressed 1 time).

3. **Decision**:
   - The **red button** has the highest average reward (0.6) and has been pressed only 5 times, so it is a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - However, buttons like **yellow**, **orange**, **brown**, and **pink** have been pressed very few times and could potentially have higher rewards than their current averages suggest. Exploring these buttons could lead to discovering a better option.

4. **Trade-off**: Given that we have 59 remaining time steps, it’s still worth exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to ensure we don’t miss out on a potentially better option. However, since the **red button** has shown the highest reward so far, it’s a safe choice for exploitation.

### Final Decision:
Given the high average reward of the **red button** and the need to maximize immediate rewards while still leaving room for exploration later, the best choice is to press the **red button** again.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are **red**, **purple**, **black**, and **white**, all with an average reward of **0.5**. These are strong candidates for exploitation.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **yellow**, **orange**, **brown**, and **pink** have been pressed very few times (2 or fewer) and have an average reward of **0.0**. However, their true reward means could be higher, and we need more data to confirm.

3. **Balancing Act**: Since we’re only 42 time steps in (out of 100), we still have room to explore. However, we should prioritize buttons that have shown promise but haven’t been pressed as much as others.

4. **Decision**: Among the high-reward buttons, **red** and **purple** have been pressed fewer times (6 and 4, respectively) compared to **black** (12 times). This makes **red** and **purple** good candidates for further exploitation. However, **purple** has been pressed fewer times than **red**, so it’s a better choice to gather more data while still aiming for a high reward.

3. **Decision**: Given that we have 57 time steps remaining, we should prioritize exploiting the buttons with the highest known rewards while still exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to avoid missing out on potentially better options.

- **Red, Black, and White** are tied with the highest average reward of 0.5. Since **Black** has been pressed the most (12 times), it might be slightly over-explored compared to **Red** and **White**.
- **Red** and **White** have both been pressed 6 times, which is a moderate number of trials. Given that they both have the highest average reward, they are strong candidates for exploitation.

To balance exploitation and exploration, I will choose **Red** as it has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, allowing us to gather more data on its potential while still aiming for high rewards.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Black button**: Average reward of 0.5 (pressed 12 times).
   - **White button**: Average reward of 0.5 (pressed 6 times).
   - **Red button**: Average reward of 0.4286 (pressed 7 times).
   - **Blue button** and **Purple button**: Average reward of 0.4 (pressed 5 times each).

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times and have low or zero average rewards, but their true means are still uncertain:
   - **Yellow button**: Average reward of 0.0 (pressed 2 times).
   - **Orange button**: Average reward of 0.0 (pressed 2 times).
   - **Brown button**: Average reward of 0.0 (pressed 1 time).
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of 0.0 (pressed 1 time).

3. **Strategy**: Since we have only 56 time steps left (100 - 44), we should prioritize exploiting the buttons with the highest known rewards while still exploring a few under-sampled buttons to ensure we don’t miss a potentially better option.

### Decision:
- **Black button** has the highest average reward (0.5) and has been pressed a moderate number of times (12), making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
- **White button** also has a high average reward (0.5) but has been pressed fewer times (6), so it’s also a good choice.
- **Yellow**, **Orange**, **Brown**, and **Pink buttons** have very low sample counts and zero rewards, but exploring them further could reveal higher rewards.

Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, the **Black button** is the best choice for this step because it has the highest proven reward and has been sampled enough to be reliable.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation vs. Exploration**:  
   - **Black button**: Highest average reward (0.5385) with 13 presses. This is a strong candidate for exploitation.  
   - **White button**: Second-highest average reward (0.5) with 6 presses. Also a good candidate.  
   - **Red button**: Third-highest average reward (0.4286) with 7 presses. Another solid option.  
   - **Blue and Purple buttons**: Both have an average reward of 0.4 with 5 presses each. Decent but not as promising as black or white.  
   - **Green button**: Average reward of 0.3333 with 3 presses. Less attractive.  
   - **Yellow, Orange, Brown, Pink buttons**: All have an average reward of 0.0, but they have been pressed very few times (1-2 times). These are candidates for exploration.  

2. **Prioritizing Exploration**:  
   - Buttons like **yellow, orange, brown, and pink** have been pressed very few times and have shown no reward yet. Exploring these could reveal higher rewards, but the risk is high.  
   - Given that we have 55 time steps left, it’s worth exploring at least one of these under-explored buttons to gather more data.  

3. **Final Decision**:  
   - **Black button** is the safest choice for exploitation, but exploring an under-explored button could yield higher long-term rewards.  
   - Let’s explore **yellow** since it has been pressed only twice and has shown no reward yet. This could help us determine if it’s worth pressing more in the future.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the best-performing buttons so far:**
   - **Black button**: Highest average reward (0.53846) with 13 presses.
   - **White button**: Second-highest average reward (0.5) with 6 presses.
   - **Red button**: Third-highest average reward (0.42857) with 7 presses.

2. **Consider exploration for under-pressed buttons:**
   - **Orange, brown, and pink buttons** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to bad luck, and they might have higher true means.
   - **Yellow and green buttons** have been pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.33333, which is lower than the top performers but still worth exploring further.

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration:**
   - Since we have 54 time steps remaining (100 - 46), we can afford to explore a bit more while still exploiting the best-performing buttons.
   - The **black button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, so it’s a strong candidate for exploitation.
   - However, we should also explore buttons like **orange, brown, or pink** to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially high-reward buttons.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Given the high average reward of the **black button** and the need to maximize immediate rewards, it’s a safe choice for exploitation.
   - However, to balance exploration, we could also consider pressing one of the under-explored buttons like **orange, brown, or pink**.

Since the **black button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed enough times to be reliable, it’s the best choice for maximizing immediate reward while still leaving room for exploration later.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Exploitation**: The buttons with the highest average rewards so far are:
   - **Black button**: Average reward of 0.5625 (pressed 16 times).
   - **Red button**: Average reward of 0.42857 (pressed 7 times).
   - **White button**: Average reward of 0.42857 (pressed 7 times).

2. **Exploration**: Some buttons have been pressed very few times and have low or zero average rewards, but their true means could be higher. These include:
   - **Orange button**: Average reward of 0.0 (pressed 2 times).
   - **Brown button**: Average reward of 0.0 (pressed 1 time).
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of 0.0 (pressed 1 time).

3. **Strategy**: Since we are halfway through the 100 time steps (50 steps completed), we should prioritize **exploitation** to maximize immediate rewards while still allocating some steps for **exploration**.

Given the current data:
- The **black button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed a moderate number of times, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.
- The **orange**, **brown**, and **pink** buttons have been pressed very few times and could potentially yield higher rewards if explored further.

However, since the **black button** has consistently shown the highest reward, it is the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the best-performing buttons so far:**
   - **Black button** has the highest average reward (0.588) and has been pressed 17 times.
   - **Red button** and **White button** both have the next highest average reward (0.429), but they have been pressed fewer times (7 times each).

2. **Consider exploration:**
   - Buttons like **orange**, **brown**, and **pink** have been pressed very few times (1-2 times) and have an average reward of 0.0. However, this could be due to bad luck, and they might have higher true means.
   - **Yellow** and **green** buttons have been pressed 3 times each with an average reward of 0.333, which is lower than the top performers but still worth exploring further.

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration:**
   - Since we have 49 time steps left, we should prioritize exploitation to maximize rewards but still allocate some steps to explore under-sampled buttons.
   - The **black button** is the most reliable choice for exploitation, given its high average reward and sufficient sampling.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Given the high average reward and the need to maximize total reward, the **black button** is the best choice for this step.

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration**:

   - **Exploration**: Buttons like orange, brown, and pink could potentially have higher rewards but need more presses to confirm.

4. **Decision**:

   - The **black button** has the highest average reward, but it has been pressed 23 times, which is significantly more than other buttons. This suggests we might be over-exploiting it.
   - Buttons like **orange**, **brown**, and **pink** have been pressed very few times (2, 1, and 1 respectively) and have an average reward of 0.0. However, their low average reward could be due to insufficient exploration.

3. **Prioritize exploration for under-explored buttons:**
   - Since **orange**, **brown**, and **pink** have been pressed very few times, it’s worth exploring them further to determine if they might yield higher rewards.

4. **Choose the next button:**
   - Among the under-explored buttons, **orange** has been pressed only 2 times, which is the most among the three. Exploring it further is a reasonable choice.

1. **Identify the best-performing buttons so far:**
   - **Black button** has the highest average reward (0.652) with 23 presses.
   - **Red button** and **White button** both have an average reward of 0.429, but with fewer presses (7 each).

2. **Consider exploration:**
   - Buttons like **orange**, **brown**, and **pink** have been pressed very few times (3, 1, and 1 respectively) and have low or zero average rewards. However, they could still have higher true means, so exploring them might be beneficial.

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration:**
   - Since we have only 42 time steps left (100 - 58 = 42), we should prioritize exploitation more than exploration, especially for buttons that have already shown high rewards.
   - The **black button** has the highest average reward and a reasonable number of presses, making it a strong candidate for exploitation.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Given the high average reward of the **black button** and the limited remaining time steps, it’s the best choice to maximize the total reward.

2. **Consider under-explored buttons:**
   - **Orange, brown, and pink buttons** have very low or zero average rewards but have been pressed only 1-3 times. They could potentially have higher rewards if explored further.

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration:**
   - **Exploitation**: The black button has the highest average reward and is a safe choice to maximize immediate reward.
   - **Exploration**: The orange, brown, and pink buttons are under-explored and could yield higher rewards if their true means are higher than their current averages.

4. **Decision:**

   - **Black button** has the highest average reward, but it has been pressed the most, so its reward distribution is relatively well-understood.
   - **Red and White buttons** have similar average rewards but have been pressed fewer times, so there might be more uncertainty about their true reward distributions.
   - **Other buttons** like blue, purple, green, and yellow have lower average rewards but have been pressed fewer times, so they might still have potential.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the best-performing buttons so far:**
   - **Black button** has the highest average reward (0.6296) and has been pressed 27 times.
   - **Red button** and **White button** both have the next highest average reward (0.4286), but they have been pressed fewer times (7 times each).

2. **Consider exploration:**
   - **Orange button**, **Brown button**, and **Pink button** have been pressed very few times (5, 2, and 1 times respectively) and have an average reward of 0.0. These buttons might have higher rewards that we haven’t discovered yet.

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration:**
   - Since we have 35 time steps left (100 - 65 = 35), we should prioritize exploitation to maximize rewards but also allocate some steps for exploration.
   - The **Black button** is the most reliable choice for exploitation, given its high average reward and sufficient data.

4. **Decision:**
   - Given the high average reward of the **Black button** and the remaining time steps, it’s a good choice to maximize immediate rewards while still leaving room for exploration later.

1. **Exploitation**: The **black button** has the highest average reward (0.642857) and has been pressed 28 times, indicating it’s a reliable choice for high rewards.  
2. **Exploration**: Some buttons (e.g., pink, brown, orange) have been pressed very few times and have low or zero average rewards. Exploring these could reveal higher rewards, but the risk is high.  
3. **Middle Ground**: Buttons like **blue**, **purple**, **red**, and **white** have moderate average rewards and have been pressed a reasonable number of times. They are safer choices than unexplored buttons but less rewarding than the black button.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the highest average reward buttons**:  
   - **Black button**: Average reward of **0.6207** over **29 presses**.  
   - **Red button**: Average reward of **0.4286** over **7 presses**.  
   - **White button**: Average reward of **0.4286** over **7 presses**.  
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of **0.4** over **5 presses**.  
   - **Purple button**: Average reward of **0.4** over **5 presses**.  

2. **Evaluate the black button**:  
   - The black button has the highest average reward (**0.6207**) and has been pressed **29 times**, which is a substantial number of trials. This suggests it is a reliable choice for exploitation.  

3. **Consider other high-reward buttons**:  
   - The red and white buttons have the same average reward (**0.4286**) but fewer presses (**7 times each**). They could still have higher true means, so exploring them further might be beneficial.  
   - The blue and purple buttons have lower average rewards (**0.4**) but are worth considering if the black button’s performance declines.  

4. **Exploration vs. exploitation**:  
   - Since we have only **33 time steps left** (100 - 67), we should prioritize exploitation of the best-known button while still exploring other promising options.  
   - The black button has the highest reward and sufficient data to trust its performance, so it is the best choice for exploitation.  

5. **Final decision**:  
   - The **black button** is the optimal choice given its high average reward and sufficient exploration.

2. **Exploration**: Buttons like **pink** (pressed only once) and **brown** (pressed twice) have not been explored much, but their average rewards are 0.0, which is not promising. However, they could still have higher true means, so exploring them slightly might be worthwhile.
3. **Other Buttons**:

   - **Blue** and **purple** have average rewards of 0.4 and have been pressed 5 times each, making them moderate choices.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the best-performing buttons so far:**
   - **Black button**: Average reward of 0.6129 (highest) with 31 presses.
   - **Red button**: Average reward of 0.4286 with 7 presses.
   - **White button**: Average reward of 0.4286 with 7 presses.
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of 0.4 with 5 presses.
   - **Purple button**: Average reward of 0.4 with 5 presses.

2. **Consider exploration for under-pressed buttons:**
   - **Orange button**: Average reward of 0.0 with 5 presses (might be worth exploring further).
   - **Brown button**: Average reward of 0.0 with 2 presses (might be worth exploring further).
   - **Pink button**: Average reward of 0.0 with 1 press (definitely worth exploring further).

3. **Balance exploitation and exploration:**
   - The **black button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed 31 times, so it’s a safe bet for exploitation.
   - However, we still have 31 time steps left, and exploring under-pressed buttons like **pink**, **brown**, or **orange** could reveal higher rewards.

4. **Decision:**
   - Given the high reward of the **black button** and the limited time left, it’s prudent to continue exploiting it while occasionally exploring under-pressed buttons.
   - Since **pink** has only been pressed once and has an average reward of 0.0, it’s a good candidate for exploration to see if it might yield higher rewards.

**Final Choice:**  
Given the balance between exploitation and exploration, and the fact that **pink** has been pressed only once, it’s worth exploring further.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Highest Average Reward**: The black button has the highest average reward of 0.6176, and it has been pressed 34 times. This suggests that it is a strong candidate for maximizing immediate rewards.

2. **Other High-Reward Buttons**: The red and white buttons both have an average reward of 0.4286, which is also relatively high. However, they have been pressed fewer times (7 times each), so there is more uncertainty about their true reward potential.

3. **Low-Reward Buttons**: Buttons like orange, brown, and pink have an average reward of 0.0, indicating that they are unlikely to provide significant rewards. These should be avoided unless we need to explore them further.

4. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Since we have already pressed the black button 34 times and it has consistently provided a high reward, it is a safe choice for exploitation. However, we should also consider exploring buttons with fewer presses but potentially high rewards, like red and white, to ensure we are not missing out on better options.

Given the current data, the black button remains the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate rewards. However, to balance exploration and exploitation, we could occasionally try the red or white buttons to gather more data.

For this time step, the best choice is to press the black button again, as it has the highest proven reward.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Highest Average Reward**:  
   - The **black button** has the highest average reward of **0.6** over **35 presses**. This suggests it is a strong candidate for exploitation.

2. **Other High-Reward Buttons**:  
   - The **red** and **white** buttons both have an average reward of **0.42857** over **7 presses** each. These are also good candidates but have been pressed fewer times than the black button.  
   - The **blue** and **purple** buttons have an average reward of **0.4** over **5 presses** each, which is slightly lower than red and white.

3. **Under-Explored Buttons**:  
   - The **orange**, **brown**, and **pink** buttons have an average reward of **0.0** but have been pressed only **5**, **2**, and **2** times, respectively. These buttons could potentially have higher rewards but need more exploration.

4. **Strategy**:  
   - Since we have only **26 time steps left** (100 - 74), we should prioritize **exploitation** of the best-known button while still allocating some presses to under-explored buttons.  
   - The **black button** is the clear leader in terms of both average reward and number of presses, so it is the safest choice for maximizing immediate reward.

### Final Decision:  
Given the limited time steps remaining and the strong performance of the black button, the optimal choice is to press the **black button** again.

Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice.","To maximize the total reward over the remaining 12 time steps, we need to balance between exploiting the buttons with the highest known average rewards and exploring buttons that have been pressed fewer times to better understand their potential rewards.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the buttons with the highest average rewards so far:**
   - **Black button**: Average reward of 0.5306 (pressed 49 times)
   - **Red button**: Average reward of 0.4286 (pressed 7 times)
   - **White button**: Average reward of 0.4286 (pressed 7 times)
   - **Blue button**: Average reward of 0.4 (pressed 5 times)
   - **Purple button**: Average reward of 0.4 (pressed 5 times)

2. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation:**
   - **Black button** has the highest average reward and has been pressed the most, so it’s a safe choice for exploitation.
   - **Red** and **White buttons** have similar high average rewards but have been pressed fewer times, so they could still be worth exploring.
   - **Blue** and **Purple buttons** have decent average rewards but have been pressed fewer times than Black, so they could also be worth exploring.

3. **Buttons with zero average reward:**
   - **Orange**, **Brown**, and **Pink buttons** have an average reward of 0.0. Given the limited time steps remaining (12), it’s unlikely that exploring these buttons will yield a higher total reward compared to exploiting the higher-reward buttons.

4. **Decision:**
   - **Black button** is the most reliable choice for maximizing immediate reward, given its high average and the number of times it has been pressed.
   - However, to ensure we’re not missing out on potentially higher rewards from less-explored buttons, we could occasionally explore **Red** or **White buttons**.

Given the remaining 12 time steps, the best strategy is to primarily exploit the **Black button** while occasionally exploring **Red** or **White buttons** to confirm their potential.

2. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**: Since we only have 9 time steps left, the focus should primarily be on exploitation—choosing the button with the highest expected reward. However, buttons like blue, red, and white also have decent average rewards and fewer presses, which could indicate potential for higher rewards.

3. **Evaluate the top contenders**:
   - **Black button**: Highest average reward and most presses, making it the safest choice.
   - **Red and white buttons**: Both have the same average reward (0.42857142857142855) and have been pressed 7 times each. They are less explored than black but have shown good performance.
   - **Blue and purple buttons**: Both have an average reward of 0.4 and have been pressed 5 times each. They are slightly less promising than red and white but still better than others.

   - **Black button**: 0.55357 (highest average reward, pressed 56 times)  
   - **Red button**: 0.42857 (pressed 7 times)  
   - **White button**: 0.42857 (pressed 7 times)  
   - **Blue button**: 0.4 (pressed 5 times)  
   - **Purple button**: 0.4 (pressed 5 times)  
   - **Green button**: 0.33333 (pressed 3 times)  
   - **Yellow button**: 0.33333 (pressed 3 times)  
   - **Orange button**: 0.0 (pressed 5 times)  
   - **Brown button**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)  
   - **Pink button**: 0.0 (pressed 2 times)  

2. **Consider exploration vs. exploitation**:  
   - With only 5 time steps left, the focus should be on **exploitation** (choosing the button with the highest known reward) rather than exploring buttons with low or zero rewards.  

3. **Choose the best button**:  
   - The **black button** has the highest average reward (0.55357) and has been pressed enough times to be reliable.
